Graduation was right around the corner and so was a nursing job at a hospital not far from her hometown on New York's Long Island. In an exclusive interview with \"48 Hours,\" Haley's mother Karen Anderson told CBS News' Maria Elena Salinas she was thrilled at the prospect of having her daughter home again and was planning a big celebration. Karen never dreamed that Haley would not make it to her graduation. It all started in the early morning hours of Thursday, March 8. Haley and her roommates had been up playing board games and drinking, when they finally went to bed around 4 a.m. Haley's roommate and close friend Josie Artin, who also spoke only to \"48 Hours,\" says that by the time she woke up Haley was gone. At first, Artin says she wasn't concerned. \"When I first didn't hear from her, I didn't think, 'Oh, something terrible has happened.'\" Haley was very independent and capable, says Artin. She also had a lot of friends and dated a lot. It never occurred to Artin or Haley's other roommates that their friend might be in trouble. It wasn't until later that night, when Haley didn't show up to a gathering at a local bar, that they began to worry. Haley had never stood them up before, and it wasn't like her to disappear off social media or let repeated phone calls go unanswered. So one of her roommates decided to track Haley's iPhone using the app \"Find My Friends,\" and found that Haley's cellphone was at fellow nursing student Orlando Tercero's apartment. After connecting with Haley at a party, Tercero became her friend with benefits. His roommate Jesse Bua told \"48 Hours\" that Orlando cared deeply for Haley. But it was a friendship fraught with tension. Says Bua, \"Sometimes they were bickeringâ¦ and other times they would laugh hystericallyâ¦ and other times they kept their distances and wouldn't see each other for a little bit.\" Artin says Tercero was extremely jealous of anyone Haley spent time with and started driving by their house, often stopping by uninvited. When Haley's iPhone appeared to be at Tercero's apartment, Artin and another roommate, Mishela Topalli, went in search of their friend. What they didn't know was that Tercero's sister had already called the police. Her brother had left her a concerning voicemail and she wanted someone to do a welfare check. Police knocked on the door, and when no one answered, they left. Tercero's car was gone, and it seemed that no one was home. Artin and Topalli also knocked and got no answer, but knowing that Haley's phone was still inside, they decided to climb through a window.  Within hours, police would find security camera footage from several different locations that became evidence in a murder case. Starting with a camera at Tercero's house that captured him and Haley first entering his apartment â and ending with cameras at JFK International Airport that showed Tercero boarding a plane home to Nicaragua. Born in Miami to a well-to-do Nicaraguan family, Tercero held dual citizenship and was raised in Nicaragua. When he fled there, authorities in the United States worried that he got away with murder.", "section": "48 Hours", "bylines": ["CBS News"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "When college student Haley Anderson first went missing, her roommates were not alarmed.

Unemployment will likely remain in double-digits into 2021, according to the agency.The CBO's forecast underscores the pandemic's devastating impact on the economy. The nation's gross domestic product â the total value of goods and services â is expected to plunge at an annualized rate of 40% between April and June before rebounding in the second half of the year. The CBO projects overall annual economic growth of -5.6%, down sharply from 2.1% the previous year. More than 26 million Americans have applied of unemployment benefits in little more than a month.

The 2020 budget deficit will explode after four coronavirus response bills passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump promise to pile more than $2 trillion onto the $24.6 trillion national debt in just the remaining six months of the current fiscal year, according to the report. That's more than double the deficit record set during former President Barack Obama's first year in office.Another worry is the further reduction of government revenues that already were well below historic averages, even as the spending side of the federal ledger climbs due to the retirement costs of the baby boomers to Medicare and Social Security, record Pentagon spending and long-term COVID-19 response costs.Even Washington's few remaining spending hawks say the flood of red ink should not be a focus in the short term as the government takes unprecedented steps to respond to a shrinking economy, unemployment levels not seen since the Great Depression, and shutdown orders lasting well into next month or beyond.But when policymakers inevitably are forced to take on deficits, virtually none of them will have any experience in successfully doing so.

Mr. Trump remarked at Thursday's White House briefing that he's seen that disinfectant \"knocks it (COVID-19) out in a minute. And is there a way you can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning? As you see, it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs -- so it'll be interesting to check that. ... It sounds interesting to me.\"But William Bryan, head of science and technology at the Department of Homeland Security, seemed to shoot the idea down as quickly as it was mentioned, saying it wasn't being considered. When a reporter asked Bryan, \"There's no scenario that could be injected into a person, is there?\" Bryan replied, \"No.\"Asked about his comment again on Friday, Mr. Trump said, \"I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen.\" The idea of using disinfectant products in that way met with quick rebuke from the medical community. \"Just because something works outside of the body doesn't mean you should bring it inside the body, where it could potentially cause severe damage,\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook explained on \"CBS This Morning\" Friday. He added, \"The last thing you want is somebody hearing this, hearing this kind of a statement, and then â being very ill themselves, and saying, 'You know what, I'm gonna just give it a try.'\"Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said in an emailed statement, \"It would be incredibly dangerous to inject any chemicals or sanitizers to treat coronavirus. There is absolutely no merit or any medical evidence to suggest this in any way.\"John Balmes, a pulmonologist at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, stressed to Bloomberg News that, \"Inhaling chlorine bleach would be absolutely the worst thing for the lungs. The airway and lungs are not made to be exposed to even an aerosol of disinfectant.\"Kashif Mahmood, a doctor in Charleston, West Virginia, said on Twitter, \"As a physician, I can't recommend injecting disinfectant into the lungs or using UV radiation inside the body to treat Covid-19. Don't take medical advice from Trump.\"RB, the manufacturer of Lysol, issued a statement stressing that injecting disinfectants would be unsafe, saying:\"Due to recent speculation and social media activity, RB (the makers of Lysol and Dettol) has been asked whether internal administration of disinfectants may be appropriate for investigation or use as a treatment for coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).  We must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route).\"The EPA also stressed that disinfectant products should be used for cleaning household surfaces, not the human body. \"When using an EPA-registered disinfectant, follow the label directions for safe, effective use,\" the agency says. It released an updated statement Thursday that included this advice: \"Never apply the product to yourself or others. Do not ingest disinfectant products. This includes never applying any product on List N (the agency's list of disinfectants to use against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19) directly to food.\" As for heat and humidity, past studies haven't found good evidence that the warmer temperatures and higher humidity of spring and summer will help tamp down the spread of the virus. But Bryan said there are \"emerging results\" from new research that suggest solar light has a powerful effect in killing the virus on surfaces and in the air. He said scientists have seen a similar effect from higher temperatures and humidity. A biocontainment lab in Maryland has been conducting testing on the virus since February, Bryan said.\"The virus is dying at a much more rapid pace just from exposure to higher temperatures and just from exposure to humidity,\" Bryan said.He said knowing more about it could help governors when making decisions about how and when to open their state economies. However, he emphasized that the emerging results of the light and heat studies don't replace social distancing recommendations. Mr. Trump, who has consistently looked for hopeful news about containing the virus, was asked if it was dangerous to make people think they would be safe by going outside in the heat, considering that so many people have died in Florida. \"I hope people enjoy the sun. And if it has an impact, that's great,\" Mr. Trump replied, adding, \"It's just a suggestion from a brilliant lab by a very, very smart, perhaps brilliant man.\"\"I'm here to present ideas, because we want ideas to get rid of this thing. And if heat is good, and if sunlight is good, that's a great thing as far as I'm concerned,\" the president said.Mr. Trump has often talked up prospects for new therapies and offered rosy timelines for the development of a vaccine. Earlier in the month, scientific advisers told the White House there's no good evidence yet that the heat and humidity of summer will rein in the virus without continued public health measures. ", "section": "Health", "bylines": ["CBS News"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "The medical community was quick to shoot down the idea, pointing out its dangers.", "originalurl": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-trump-injecting-disinfectant-covid-19/", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.15606644920025203, "subjectivity": 0.47626237221307643, "wordcount": 867}

Gilday had ordered the investigation into the firing. Crozier was removed from his command after a memo he circulated pleading for help from Washington became public.

The casualties have been counted. California's new ammunition background check law misfires and the Second Amendment rights of California citizens have been gravely injured,\" Benitez wrote in a 120-page opinion granting the group's motion for a preliminary injunction.Voters approved toughening California's already strict firearms laws in 2016, and the restrictions took effect last July.New York was the first state to require a comprehensive ammunition background check system for each sale, but it never took effect. That left California as the first to the extend firearm background checks to each ammunition sale.Four other states - Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and New Jersey - require buyers to undergo background checks to obtain firearms or ammunition licenses that they must show when buying bullets, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.Hannah Shearer, the center's litigation director, called the ruling \"a dangerous step in the wrong direction\" at a time when gun stores are seeing increased sales to those worried about the effect of the coronavirus on society or their safety.\"The law's red tape and state database errors made it impossible for hundreds of thousands of law-abiding Californians to purchase ammunition for sport or self-defense,\" said Chuck Michel, the association's general counsel. \"The court found that the flimsy reasons offered by the government to justify these constitutional infringements were inadequate.\"He expected the state to appeal the ruling. But in the meantime, \"Californians can sleep a little easier tonight knowing their Constitutional rights were restored and strengthened by this decision,\" he said. Governor Gavin Newsom championed the law before he became governor, and spokeswoman Vicky Waters said his administration is disappointed by the decision and considering its next steps. \"California's strong gun safety laws help keep our schools and communities safe,\" she said.The state attorney general's office said only that it is reviewing the decision. It did not immediately say if it would appeal or seek to stay the order, which takes effect immediately at a time when some California gun stores have been ordered shut because of the coronavirus. Among the places where the shops were not deemed essential businesses are Los Angeles and San Jose. The same judge's decision last year striking down the state's ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines sparked a week-long buying frenzy before he halted sales while the state appeals his ruling. Gun owners similarly rushed to stockpile ammunition before the new restrictions took effect last summer. Benitez called the ammunition background check law \"onerous and convoluted\" and \"constitutionally defective.\"\"Criminals, tyrants, and terrorists don't do background checks,\" he wrote. \"The background check experiment defies common sense while unduly and severely burdening the Second Amendment rights of every responsible, gun-owning citizen desiring to lawfully buy ammunition.\"While it is intended to keep ammunition from criminals, it blocked sales to legitimate, law-abiding buyers about 16% of the time, he wrote. Moreover, he ruled that the state's ban on importing ammunition from outside California violates federal interstate commerce laws.California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a court filing earlier this month that the background checks stopped more than 750 people from buying bullets illegally from July 2019 through January 2020, not including those who didn't even try because they knew they weren't eligible.The law requires buyers who already are in the state's firearm background check database to pay a $1 fee each time they buy ammunition, while others can buy longer-term licenses if they do not have certain criminal convictions or mental health commitments.It took an average of less than 5 minutes to complete the background checks, according to state court filings.\"There is no substantial impediment,\" the state said in court documents. \"Ammunition purchasers must pass an eligibility check that, in the vast majority of cases, delays a purchase by a few minutes.\"Benitez ruled that the ammunition law illegally locks out-of-state vendors out of California's market, and that it conflicts with a federal law allowing gun owners to bring their firearms and ammunition through California.The lawsuit by California Rifle & Pistol Association was joined by out-of-state ammunition sellers and California residents, including Kim Rhode.

Professor Sarah Gilbert heads the Oxford team behind the potential vaccine being developed in partnership with the Jenner Institute. She's said it has an \"80% chance\" of success, and it could be available for wide use by the public as soon as September.Human trials of the vaccine began Thursday in Oxford. It will be administered to 510 healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55.U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said the government is \"throwing everything\" at efforts in the country to create a COVID-19 vaccine. He's pledged around $25 million in public funding for the Oxford project and an additional $27 million to research initiatives at Imperial College London. He says the U.K. is \"at the front of the global effort\" to find a vaccine.\"We have put more money than any other country into a global search for a vaccine and, for all the efforts around the world, two of the leading vaccine developments are taking place here at home, at Oxford and Imperial,\" Hancock said. \"Both of these promising projects are making rapid progress, and I've told the scientists leading them we will do everything in our power to support.\"COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus first detected late last year in central China, has killed more than 184,000 people globally, and over 2.6 million have caught the virus. Global race for a vaccineAlthough there are 120 projects around the world working toward a vaccine, only five have been approved for clinical trials on humans. As well as the Oxford initiative, a joint partnership between German biotech company BioNTech and U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer will begin trialing a potential vaccine later this month. It will be tested on 200 German volunteers aged between 18 and 55. The first human trial in the U.S. began in March. That vaccine is made by Moderna Inc. and is being administered at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle.  Forty-five healthy adults, aged 18 to 55, are enrolled in that trial, each of whom will receive two shots, 28 days apart. China also approved its first human trial for a potential vaccine in March. Conducted by the military-backed Academy of Military Medical Sciences and the Hong Kong-listed biotech firm CanSino Bio, researchers involved say the trial has already shown \"positive results.\" It's not just vaccines that scientists are looking for: Researchers are also trialing existing drugs as potential treatments for the new coronavirus disease, including long-trusted remedies for killer pathogens including Ebola, malaria and HIV.Early results have been mixed, but until full clinical trials are done and the data analyzed, doctors can't be certain that any of the medications are safe and effective. Treatments aside, experts say the world will only be able to breathe a real sigh of relief when a vaccine is ready to distribute widely around the world. Despite the confidence of the Oxford scientists and the fast-tracking of human vaccine trials, most experts still think that will take another 12 to 18 months.", "section": "World", "bylines": ["Imtiaz Tyab"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "Britain's government is putting more than $50 million toward the race for a coronavirus vaccine, and says \"promising projects are making rapid progress.\"", "originalurl": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-vaccine-covid-19-human-clinical-trial-oxford-england/", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.11168280871670701, "subjectivity": 0.39337809083571795, "wordcount": 536}

The change comes as the coronavirus pandemic upended the political world, ending traditional campaign rallies, causing primaries to be conducted entirely by mail, and even putting the fate of the national convention into question.  \"We pride ourselves for having the largest convention in the country,\" said Texas Democratic Party deputy executive director Cliff Walker. \"It's the biggest gathering of Democrats outside of the DNC (Democratic National Convention). But now that we're having to make some adjustments, I think it really does give us some opportunities.\"As the coronavirus spread nationally in March, party leaders realized they may not be able to hold their customary convention, with thousands of Texas packed into a San Antonio convention center in early June, and they started looking at ways to reinvent the event for 2020 and beyond. The party announced the decision to transform its in-person convention into a virtual one in March, but is sharing details of how it will execute the plan for the first time.\"We firmly believe that this is the future of what conventions can look like,\" said Texas Democratic Party Convention director Hannah Roe Beck. \"There's a big opportunity for innovation here. I think that a lot of the things that you'll see us doing this year are things that we're going to want to carry over.\" The party plans to hold its virtual convention during the first week of June using two channels: One for official party business like voting on delegates and one with speakers, performances, and panels. The party is still in talks with the production company and the speakers about where the locations for the broadcast events, but the idea is to build a TV studio and control room to deliver the feed.    According to convention organizers, the \"main stage\" channel with speakers and panels will be broadcast on social media platforms such as Facebook. The party business will be conducted on a video chat platform like Zoom that will feature a grid of video boxes and allow participants to interact and ask questions.   The state party's executive director Manny Garcia hopes holding the convention online will allow more people to participate and engage in the state's politics. \"It's important for us to take this opportunity with the convention and say, hey, for some folks that maybe had never been able to participate before, that couldn't take the time to come to a city and pay for a hotel and pay for the travel and and do all of that, they can still experience the convention,\" Garcia said.  The traditional in-person convention usually draws 10,000 to 15,000 people, according to the state party's brand director Brittany Switzer, who worked on the 2016 and 2018 state conventions. She expects \"more folks than ever\" will tune into the convention this year.  Generally, conventions are the arena where the party introduces its platform and candidates, kicking off the general election campaign. Texas Democratic Party chair Gilberto Hinojosa likened the traditional convention to a pep rally ahead of a Friday night football game where \"you would pump up the team,\" which is harder to do when the convention is online.\"We're not going to have that in the sense that, you know, that the crowd's going to be out there cheering on the team,\" Hinojosa said, \"But that's the best we can do under the circumstances.\" One of the main functions of the state convention is to elect the 228 pledged national delegates who will represent Texas at the DNC convention. For voting on delegates and other party business, the state party has built out a system using Google Forms to insert preferences.  Voting will be divided up across multiple days, instead of the traditional one to two days of voting, so that users with varying technological equipment and expertise have the time to participate. Party officials said there will be testing and extensive training on the process ahead of the convention. The DNC has been hyperfocused on security since the DNC's emails were hacked during the 2016 national convention. Garcia said voting will be secure with because of measures like two-factor authentication and publicly recorded votes. \"There are no secret ballots,\" Garcia said. \"We will have tabulations of voting public up on our website. And so folks have an opportunity to review everything.\"The Democratic National Committee has already delayed its convention from July to August in response to the coronavirus pandemic. DNC chair Chairman Tom Perez said Thursday that the party expects \"to hold an in-person convention in Milwaukee,\" but will continue monitoring the situation in Wisconsin, according to the Associated Press.  The presumptive nominee, Joe Biden, said in early April that Democrats might need to have a virtual convention. On Monday, Biden told WTMJ in Milwaukee that he's not sure if Democrats can hold a large in-person gathering. \"I honest to God don't know,\" Biden said. \"It depends on what the science tells us. If we open up too quickly now, that will unlikely occur.\" If the Texas Democrats are successful, it could provide the DNC with a blueprint for changes to the convention in Milwaukee. Even as Texas Democrats though the Texans are turning the second- largest Democratic convention into a virtual event, Garcia acknowledged that the scope of a national convention is much larger.  \"We're certainly happy to tell every state party in the country...and the DNC as well, what we are doing and how we're how we're getting it done,\" Garcia said. \"But, I know the challenge for the national convention is much larger than ours.\" As Texas Democrats navigate the uncharted territory of pulling off a massive virtual political convention, Walker said his biggest concern is that the party has never done something like this. But, he notes there are also major challenges for in-person conventions and he believes things could operate smoothly with proper preparation. \"I think that what keeps me alert is the potential for surprises,\" Walker said. \"I think with careful planning and some test runs, I'm not terribly worried. I'm actually very confident that it's going to be great.\" Democrats are still haunted by disarray in the reporting of the Iowa caucus results, with Hinojosa calling technology problems his \"biggest fear.\" \"I know that that was something that they really tried hard to avoid,\" Hinojosa said. \"But, you know, as hard as they tried, it happened and that's my biggest fear. We don't want something like that to occur.\"", "section": "Politics", "bylines": ["CBS News"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "The Texas Democratic Party convention is the second-largest event after the massive national party convention.", "originalurl": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-texas-democrats-plan-to-pull-off-an-all-virtual-convention/", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.14005230880230882, "subjectivity": 0.4900372775372775, "wordcount": 1103}

The former New York City mayor is donating millions of dollars to help finance the program and will design the unique undertaking.Cuomo said the program will train \"an army of tracers\" to collect data on the spread of the coronavirus in the tri-state area.

Washburne, a Trump donor and member of the president's Intelligence Advisory Board, spoke to CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett for this week's episode of \"The Takeout\" podcast.Washburne said that opening up restaurants so that they could serve customers at half-capacity would not be feasible, and that keeping restaurant workers and customers at a safe distance would be difficult to enforce.\"The economics just don't work. My belief is we're either all in or we're not, because half of one restaurant is just a money loser,\" Washburne said. \"It just, practically, doesn't work.\"Washburne also shared his frustration that some of his former employees were now earning a better wage from unemployment insurance than they had at his restaurant. Congress approved a relief measure last month which augments state unemployment insurance. Washburne predicted it would be difficult to rehire people when the worst of the crisis was over because \"the government soaked them all up with unemployment.\"He's also disappointed that Texas has extended a stay-at-home order in his state, meaning that his restaurants may remain closed to dine-in customers until June.\"We're very disappointed. We're not open; we think we should be open,\" Washburne said.His company has received a loan as part of the Paycheck Protection Program, but he said the bulk of that money would go to paying outstanding bills.Washburne said that he typically employs around 2,200 people at his Dallas-based chain of high-end Mexican restaurants, but he has furloughed approximately 1800 workers because of the coronavirus pandemic.\"It was a very surreal time for us,\" Washburne said of the decision to temporarily close the restaurants. His takeout sales have increased because more people are staying at home, but Washburne noted that it's more expensive to provide takeout meals than to have people eat in the restaurant because of packaging costs.\"It's not like it's a profit-making venture; we primarily did it to keep people employed,\" Washburne said about expanding his restaurants' takeout capacity.For more of Major's conversation with Washburne, download \"The Takeout\" podcast on Art19, iTunes, GooglePlay, Spotify and Stitcher.

According to the Los Angeles Police Department, thieves are also taking advantage of safety measures delivery drivers are following to protect themselves from coronavirus. Police said the drivers are being instructed not to touch doorknobs, gate latches, or any frequently touched surfaces. Sometimes, instead of at your door, packages are placed in exposed visible locations, making it easier for porch pirates to steal. A man in the  Melrose District in Los Angeles recently had a package stolen that was left right on a resident's walkway . Police said the video showed a porch pirate in action. Detectives believe the man followed a delivery driver and once the package was left in the front yard, the suspect got out of his car, opened the fence, snatched the package, and left. Pete White, a delivery driver for a big name company said, \"We always get notices that people are following us, describe the color of the vehicle they're in, describe the people, saying be careful out there are people following you.

A loophole in the bill allowed large chains — including Ruth's Hospitality Group, which operates more than 100 steakhouses across the U.S. — to apply for loans for each of its subsidiaries, despite having more than 5,000 employees and $468 million in revenue last year.  Ruth's Chris joins other restaurant companies, including  Shake Shack  and  Sweetgreen , in returning its multimillion dollar loan after facing backlash from the small business community. More than 260,000 people signed a  Change.org  petition demanding that the pricey steak joint return the loans earmarked for small businesses.  Read more here.                                                                              By Megan Cerullo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-24/#post-update-dd877c2a                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       8:05 PM / April 23, 2020              Trump says social distancing guidelines \"may\" be extended into summer or later                                                            President Trump says the administration's social distancing guidelines \"may\" extend into summer, or perhaps beyond that, as states shift gears and plan the reopening of their economies. But there is potentially good news for summer — research shows the virus' lifespan is shortened by sunlight, heat and humidity, one administration expert said during Thursday's Coronavirus Task Force briefing.  The death toll from COVID-19 in the U.S. is likely to hit 50,000 in a couple of days, and there is no indication the pace of the nation's losses — in terms of both lives and the economy — is about to slow significantly. \"We're winning this and we're gonna win it,\" Mr. Trump said as he opened up the briefing. \"And we're gonna keep watching and we're gonna watch very closely for the invisible enemy.\" Read more here.                                                                              By Kathryn Watson                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-24/#post-update-a022c1d0                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       7:20 PM / April 23, 2020              Trump weighs in on McConnell's suggestion that states could go bankrupt                                                            Asked about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's Wednesday remark that he would  rather have states declare bankruptcy  than receive more federal aid, Mr. Trump said, \"I've spoken to Mitch about it,\" and he said he's working with senators who are on the other side of the issue.  \"We're looking to do what's right for states,\" he added. But he also said that \"some states have not done well for many years,\" and they \"can't blame this horrible plague.\" He pointed to Illinois, which he said \"had problems long before the virus came in,\" likely a reference to Illinois' ballooning debt problems. Even before the pandemic struck, the state had enormous unfunded  public pension liabilities , exceeding $100 billion. The president suggested that \"it is interesting that the states that are in trouble happen to be blue,\" or run by Democrats. \"They had a lot of problems long before the plague came,\" he said. But he also said that \"it's probably going to be the next thing on the list,\" and promised that while he understands McConnell's perspective, \"we're going to do the right thing for the country.\"                                                                             By Ellen Uchimiya                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-24/#post-update-fb99c108                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       7:13 PM / April 23, 2020              Doctors find COVID-19 patients with unexpected blood clots                                                            At first, doctors found symptoms of COVID-19 that were similar to those of pneumonia.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, Latinos represent more than 27% of COVID-19 deaths in areas considered  virus hotspots , although they account for 18% of the population. They're also more likely than other groups to not be able to work from home, adding to the health risk. Chicago's Jose Gonzalez is a first-generation Mexican American, one of the nation's 60 million Latinos. \"My family has pushed me so far ahead that I can't just allow myself to sit there and do nothing,\" he told CBS News. He used to  work two jobs , but lost one in the COVID-19 shutdown. Now his life-line is cooking at a hotel housing COVID patients. \"We don't have the benefit of 'I should just stay home' ... and I feel like that's every Latino at this point right now,\" Gonzalez said.

President Trump is now expected to sign the legislation, which lawmakers approved by a vote of 388-5. The legislation, known as the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, is the result of weeks of negotiations between congressional Democrats and the White House. The measure includes $75 billion for hospitals, $25 billion to establish a national testing regime, $60 billion in disaster aid and $310 billion for the  Paycheck Protection Program  (PPP), which provides loans to small businesses to help them retain workers and meet payroll. The PPP exhausted its initial $349 billion in funding last week. The vote comes as new government data shows  4.4 million people  filed initial unemployment claims last week, raising the total number of people who have lost their jobs during the pandemic to about 26 million. Roughly $60 billion in new funds going to the PPP will be specifically targeted to financial institutions serving rural, unbanked and minority-owned businesses, a key priority for Democrats.  Minority-owned businesses  have been particularly affected by the pandemic, which has exacerbated preexisting structural issues that make it difficult for minority business owners to gain access to capital.

The virus \"dies the quickest in the presence of direct sunlight,\" Bryan told reporters at the Coronavirus Task Force briefing. According to a slide shown at the daily White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing, the virus has a half life of 18 hours on a surface when it's 70-75 degrees, with 20% humidity and no sunlight. But when the humidity rises to 80% and sunlight increases, the virus' half life drops to two minutes. Bryan talked about the existence on playground equipment as an example: In the sunlight, the virus would die very quickly, he said, although parts of the equipment in the shade would not be affected in the same way. These studies may help guide governors in their decisions about what to open and when, Bryan added. Bryan also said that bleach kills the virus in about five minutes, while isopropyl alcohol takes just 30 seconds.

The company, Phunware, which now has about 60 employees, was eligible for the low-interest loan through the Paycheck Protection Program, which is aimed at businesses with less than 500 workers. There is no allegation of illegality associated with its loan. But the size of the loan - $2.85 million - is nearly 14 times the current PPP average of $206,000. Meantime, hundreds of thousands of smaller businesses got nothing, because the nearly $350 billion loan program ran out of money in just two weeks. (Congress is allocating another $310 billion to the PPP loan fund this week.)

And even more so than last month, many are bracing for a long period before social activities can resume.  Fifty-four percent of Americans think daily life — the way people interact with each other and the way they work – will be permanently changed, while 46% think things will eventually return to normal. People living in communities that have been significantly impacted by the coronavirus are particularly likely to foresee a country forever changed: 62% of those who say their community has many cases of the coronavirus think life will be permanently changed after the virus is contained.  Read more here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-24/#post-update-b373ca87                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       4:55 PM / April 23, 2020              Prison housing Joe Exotic has the most inmate coronavirus cases of any federal prison                                                            The Federal Medical Center in Fort Worth, a prison for male inmates with medical or mental health needs, currently has more open coronavirus cases among inmates than any other federal prison in the country, the Bureau of Prisons said Thursday. FMC Fort Worth is where Joseph Maldonado-Passage, known as \"Joe Exotic\" in the Netflix series \"Tiger King,\" is currently incarcerated. FMC Fort Worth currently has 132 open cases total between inmates and staff — 131 of which are inmates — and one death, according to the BOP. Federal Correctional Institution Elkton, in Ohio, has 100 open cases, and United States Penitentiary Lompoc in California has 97. Across the entire federal system, 620 inmates and 357 staff members are currently positive for the virus, the BOP added. More than 300 inmates and 53 staff members have recovered, and 24 inmates have died.  The BOP also announced Thursday that they are ramping up testing of newly symptomatic and asymptomatic inmates by providing new testing resources through the use of Abbott ID NOW instruments. \"The deployment of these additional resources will be based on facility need to contain widespread transmission and the need for early, aggressive interventions required to slow transmission at facilities with a high number of at-risk inmates such as medical referral centers,\" the BOP said.                                                                              By Clare Hymes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-24/#post-update-56c8a135                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       4:36 PM / April 23, 2020              North Carolina extends stay-at-home order to May 8                                                            North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper announced Thursday that the state's stay-at-home order is extended until May 8. The state reported 388 new cases of the coronavirus on Thursday, its second-highest single-day yet.  \"After a thorough analysis of the details of testing, tracing, and trends, and having conversations with Trump Administration officials like Dr. Fauci, it's clear that we are on the right path but that our state is not ready to lift restrictions yet,\" Cooper tweeted.  \"We need to slow the virus before we can ease restrictions, so today I'm extending the Stay At Home order until May 8,\" he wrote. \"This includes continued closure of dine-in restaurants, bars & close-contact businesses like hair and nail salons, movie theaters & others in Executive Order 120.\" North Carolina's Secretary of Health and Human Service, Dr. Mandy Cohen, said at a press conference with the governor Thursday that the state is deviating from the White House's guidance to achieve a decline in cases before beginning to re-open, and is instead aiming for \"sustained leveling\" of cases and hospitalizations.  \"We believe a sustained leveling will also allow us to start to ease restrictions,\" Cohen said.  \"And the reason for that is because of all the hard work that North Carolina has done to slow the spread.\" \"We have not seen a surge of cases, and that's great. We have not seen a peak, we have not seen our health care system be overrun… so we're in a slightly different place,\" she said. Earlier in the day, neighboring Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said that he stands by his decision to begin  re-opening his state  as soon as Friday, despite President Trump's  disagreement  with the move.

According to new investigations from independent research and review firm Top10VPN, demand for VPNs increased by 44% over the second half of March and remain 22% higher than pre-pandemic levels. With increased VPN demand comes increased security risk. While the field has recently seen some innovative privacy developments, the nature of current VPN technology makes it a prime target for exploitation. All of a user's data is essentially funneled to a single company, whose servers may be located anywhere, and accessed by anyone.  Malicious actors have long used VPNs as cheaply created vehicles for data harvesting and malware injection. Even seemingly innocuous VPNs can — via shoddy security — endanger users in countries where VPNs are outlawed. Insecure VPN apps are routinely spotted and removed from app marketplaces.

Officials said he joined the department as a volunteer and then as a Regional Area Muslim Chaplain in 1977. On Tuesday, the department also announced the death of 52-year-old Jonathon Keith Goodman, an 11-year correctional officer at the Bill Clements Unit in Amarillo. Officials said Goodman was found in his home on Friday, April 17, suffering from a stroke. He later tested positive for COVID-19 while in the hospital and was removed from life support Tuesday afternoon. Officials believe the virus led to his death.

For the first time, the draft will take place virtually, with Commissioner Roger Goodell announcing picks from his basement. It comes as sports leagues around the world grapple with how to return after coronavirus cancellations. \"It's actually like a 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle that doesn't have borders,\" NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman told \"CBS This Morning: Saturday\" co-host Dana Jacobson. Bettman is just one executive trying to steer his sport through an unknown landscape. \"If we can play in a small window without fans, we'll be prepared to do that. If we need to go to centralized locations with no fans and modify the schedule, we'll do that. We will be as agile and as adaptable as we can be,\" he said.

One takeaway from the report is that states still lack the resources they need to reopen.  While the 38-page, 10-point roadmap relies on some of the White House and federal guidelines, the NGA's roadmap goes into much greater practical detail, focusing on the public health aspect of the pandemic more than specific business reopenings. The report observes that testing capacity in the U.S. remains \"inadequate\" to move forward, despite repeated assurances from the White House that the U.S. has enough testing for states that meet other criteria to begin to reopen.  The NGA is led by Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a vocal Republican in a blue state. President Trump derided Hogan in a White House press briefing earlier this week after Hogan and his wife secured 500,000 tests from South Korea when Hogan deemed the number the state could acquire through the federal government and U.S. companies insufficient. Mr. Trump has often said the federal government will help states while emphasizing he believes it's the governors' responsibility to secure testing and other necessary equipment on their own.  Read more here.

Kluge said that while the coronavirus outbreaks in some European countries appear to be stabilizing or decreasing, the pandemic was far from over.

And the virus attacks… old people. Nothing went wrong. Nobody's to blame for the creation of the situation, but they have to deal with the situation,\" Cuomo said,  CBS New York reported.  Cuomo said that nursing homes need to follow state rules: If they can't provide adequate care or arrange for the patient to be transferred, they are required to contact the state, which will make the arrangement. \"This state has very strict guidelines on privately run facilities. They get paid to take care of a resident. That resident, that patient must have a state-directed level of care. If they cannot provide that they can't have the resident in their facility, period. Those are the rules,\" he said. 'We're going to undertake an investigation of nursing homes now to make sure they're following the rules, it's going to be a joint Department of Health and attorney general investigation.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-24/#post-update-7425893f                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       1:31 PM / April 23, 2020              New York has paid $2.2 billion in unemployment insurance                                                            State officials said Thursday that 1.4 million New Yorkers are collecting unemployment insurance, totaling $2.2 billion that the state has already paid to workers as a result of the coronavirus.   Stay-at-home orders have put millions of Americans out of work, forcing them to apply for unemployment insurance. The Great Depression-levels of unemployment have inundated state offices, causing backlogs across the country. According to Melissa DeRosa, Secretary to Governor Andrew Cuomo, New York has paid out far more than any other state.  \"To give you a reference point, California has done $975 million, Texas $400 million, Florida $143 million, Pennsylvania $600 million,\" she said at the governor's daily press briefing Thursday.  Despite New York's unprecedented pay-out, residents are still reporting difficulty while trying to apply for and collect unemployment.  DeRosa said the majority of the backlog is due to the PUA, the CAREs Act Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program. PUA is intended to help workers not traditionally covered by unemployment, such as those who are self-employed, as well as gig and contract workers.  The PUA was not put into effect until March 27, according to DeRosa, putting those workers at a disadvantage. \"The feds then put guidance out that said you had to apply for unemployment insurance, get rejected, and then apply for pandemic unemployment insurance,\" she said. \"Which was a complete disaster.\" According to DeRosa, New York has now streamlined the process so those workers only have to apply for unemployment insurance one time, and has \"put 3,000 people on this issue.\"  Cuomo said \"the number of people who have gotten assistance is mind-boggling,\" but added that \"none of that matters.\" \"For a person there's only one check that matters, and that's their check, and I get that,\" he said.                                                                              By Audrey McNamara                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-24/#post-update-5b462990                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       1:17 PM / April 23, 2020              Oklahoma plans to start reopening its economy on Friday                                                            Oklahoma's governor plans to start to reopening parts of the state's economy this week, even after a spike in new coronavirus cases.  Governor Kevin Stitt,  a Republican, outlined  his plan  Wednesday to begin reopening the state in three phases. The first steps come Friday, when personal care businesses such as hair salons, barbershops, spas, nail salons and pet groomers can reopen only for appointments. State parks and outdoor recreation areas will also open. Gyms, restaurants, theaters, sports venues and places of worship can reopen om May 1. Stitt said all businesses must maintain social distancing and sanitation protocols. Read more here .

Michael O'Leary, CEO of Ryanair, said if the rule is implemented, the government should pay for the empty seats — or his planes will not fly.  In an interview with the  Financial Times , the budget airline executive explained plans for Ryanair to resume 80% of flights by September as long as flying in Europe could resume in July. O'Leary said the airline intends to gradually increase the number of flights, and then reduce them again in the less busy winter season.  But, he said, these plans could be foiled if there were \"some entirely ineffective social distancing measures like having middle seats empty because if middle seats are empty we're not returning to flying at all.\" Read more here .

That suggests that 2.7 million people have been infected statewide.  The survey was taken from a sample size of about 3,000 people found outside their homes, shopping at essential businesses, such as grocery stores, which remain open. Results show antibodies in 12% of women and 15.9% of men, but a disproportionate rate of antibodies in black and Latino New Yorkers.  Cuomo said the spread likely reflects the regional breakdown of the state. According to Cuomo, if the results are proven true, and the infection rate in New York is about 14%, the death rate from coronavirus may be lower than some estimates.

Doctors were able to deliver her baby boy three weeks ago, but because of the virus, Debele had to be separated from him immediately. This week, she lost her battle with the coronavirus before ever getting the chance to hold her newborn baby. On Wednesday, Mayor Kate Stewart of Takoma Park, Maryland, where Debele was a prominent member of the Ethiopian community, began the city's  virtual council meeting  with a moment of silence for the beloved local mother and her grieving family.

Professor Sarah Gilbert, who heads the Oxford team behind the potential vaccine being developed in partnership with the Jenner Institute, said it has an \"80% chance\" of success and could be available for wide use by the public as soon as September. Human trials of the vaccine began Thursday in Oxford. It will be administered to 510 healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55.

She is also a \"Dreamer,\" brought to the U.S. as a child by undocumented immigrant parents, whose future remains uncertain.  Across the U.S., about 27,000 health care workers like her are in legal limbo as they anxiously await a decision by the Supreme Court on the program known as DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. If the court sides with the Trump administration, they could be deported.  Espinoza de Piña, 26, is registered nurse who has been working on the neuro floor of SSM Health in the St. Louis, Missouri, area for three years. She mainly works with stroke and seizure patients, but since the coronavirus outbreak began she has been rotating on the isolation floor tending to COVID-19 patients. Her health isn't her only worry. The Supreme Court is expected to decide sometime in the next few weeks — by June at the latest — whether to end the  DACA program , created by the Obama administration in 2012, which allows undocumented \"Dreamers\" like her to study and work without the constant fear of having immigration officers turning up at their doors. The Trump administration is set on ending the program, and could begin deporting DACA recipients if the court clears the way.

We need to do smart things to reduce the prison population in a way that doesn't compromise public safety.\"         Budnick said he frequently receives calls from inmates he has known for years through volunteering. \"They are terrified not just for themselves, but really for their families, for their friends and for their communities,\" he said.         Budnick is best known for producing films like \"The Hangover\" and \"Old School.\" He took a break from the industry to focus on criminal justice reform. In 2013, he founded the nonprofit the Anti-Recidivism Coalition, which helps provide opportunities for people who spent time in prison. Five years later, he launched the production company, One Community, which tackles social-impact films.

The European Medicines Agency said in a statement  that chloroquine and  hydroxychloroquine  — two medicines embraced by President Trump and others as a potential COVID-19 treatment — are known to cause heart rhythm problems, especially if combined with other drugs. There is currently no licensed treatment for COVID-19 and dozens of trials are underway worldwide. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have long been used to treat malaria and anti-inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. In addition to the heart problems, the two drugs can also cause side effects including liver and kidney damage, seizures, and result in low blood sugar. \"Clinical data are still very limited and inconclusive, and the beneficial effects of these medicines in COVID-19 have not been demonstrated,\" the EMA said. It noted that several clinical trials testing the drugs' effectiveness against the coronavirus are using higher than recommended doses, which it said could increase the risk of side effects including abnormal electric activity that could disrupt the heart rhythm. Earlier this month, part of a study in Brazil was suspended after doctors found a quarter of patients taking chloroquine developed irregular heart rhythms after taking a higher dose.

It also includes $310 billion for the  Paycheck Protection Program , which provides small businesses loans to help them keep workers and meet payroll.

We will continue with this approach to protect the lives — and livelihoods — of all Georgians,\" Kemp said on Twitter.

The fallout has left roughly 1 in 6 workers without a job, a number that dwarfs the Great Recession's impact on the U.S. labor market.  The number of people filing for unemployment for the week of April 18 reflects a decline of 810,000 from the previous week, the Department of Labor  said  Thursday. Unemployment claims, reported weekly, are a barometer of the job market because they indicate how many workers have lost their jobs.  Many economists say the nation's unemployment rate is around 15% and could eventually approach 20%. The jobless rate peaked at about 25% during the Great Depression.  Click here to read more .

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a March briefing that he's always indicated that the virus \"very well might be\" a seasonal, cyclical thing, and the country should be ready.

Chock full of noise, cigarette fumes, flashing screens and masses of dazed players seated at game machines, the parlors are a form of grey-zone legalized gambling, named for the onomatopoiac sound of the hurtling steel balls in the machines.  The industry is long past its peak, but there are still more than 10,000 pachinko halls across the country netting about $200 billion per year. That's many times what gambling meccas Las Vegas and Macau  rake in , combined. Given the stakes and the highly addictive nature of pachinko, it's no wonder many parlors have ignored government requests to close down over coronavirus. CBS News partner network TBS TV, showing video of about 100 customers lined up waiting for opening time at a downtown Tokyo location, estimated that about a third of pachinko halls in the capital are still open.  At a parlor in Osaka, 600 gathered before 10 a.m. one recent morning. Stories abound of out-of-town cars filling the parking lots of parlors in adjoining prefectures, or states, and potentially carrying the virus with them. The Osaka prefectural government said pachinko parlors were the number-one source of complaints about businesses refusing to comply with urgent requests for non-essential businesses to close.  So authorities have vowed a crackdown. But, unable to  order  closures under Japan's constitution, Osaka authorities say they'll now publicly name and shame pachinko parlors for staying open. Tokyo has suggested it will do the same.  But recalcitrant players and at least one expert in gambling addiction say the intended punitive action could backfire — merely advertising which halls are still open for business.                                                                              By Lucy Craft                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-24/#post-update-cc27cb9c                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       7:47 AM / April 23, 2020              California governor allows hospitals to resume elective surgeries in 1st slight easing of lockdown                                                            California Gov. Gavin Newsom relaxed his stay-at-home order on Wednesday to let hospitals resume elective surgeries, a move that will send many thousands of idled health care employees back to work as the state takes a cautious first step toward restarting the world's fifth-largest economy.  While only a narrow opening, it was a significant milestone because just three weeks earlier Newsom had the same hospitals preparing for a worst-case scenario that could see them overwhelmed to the point that tens of thousands of additional beds would be needed to handle the overflow of patients.  Cases continue to grow in California. But it's at a manageable pace as the state's 40 million residents live under a stay-at-home order that has closed schools, beaches, parks and most businesses while canceling things like concerts and sporting events to prevent the spread of the disease.  Newsom's order took effect immediately and left it up to local governments and individual hospitals to determine how and how soon to resume elective surgeries for heart and cancer patients, among others.                                                                               By Associated Press                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-24/#post-update-acbad9b1                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       7:09 AM / April 23, 2020              Americans prioritize staying home and majority worry restrictions will lift too fast                                                            Health concerns still take precedence over economic concerns by a wide margin for Americans in their views on when to re-open the economy — both in what they want for the nation, and in what they'd do themselves. Many say they need to be confident the outbreak is over before returning to public places, and big majorities of all partisans agree the stay-at-home orders are effective. The health concerns may be so salient that even for those whose finances have been impacted and even for those concerned about job loss, most of them still worry the country will open up too fast. Sixty-three percent of Americans are more worried about restrictions lifting too fast and worsening the outbreak —than worry about lifting restrictions too slowly and worsening the economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-24/#post-update-d429cafa                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       7:05 AM / April 23, 2020              Bipartisan support for financial aid for ailing local news outlets amid pandemic                                                            Charges of \"fake news\" and \"enemy of the people\" may still emanate from the White House, but at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, there's a groundswell of support for a news industry that now finds itself grappling with drastic cuts spurred by a loss in advertising revenue thanks to the COVID-19 crisis. As newsrooms across the country undergo mass furloughs, layoffs and pay reductions, lawmakers on Capitol Hill from both parties are trying to ensure that news organizations large and small, local and national, have access to federal assistance. \"Just like people say, 'I hate Congress but I love my congressman,' in a similar way, politicians will say, 'I hate the media' but they also very much care about the health and well-being of their local news publisher, because they know the role it plays in the community and the need to get quality and reliable information to the public,\" David Chavern, president and CEO of the News Media Alliance, which represents more than 2,000 news organizations in the U.S., told CBS News.

So far 48 of the 623 crew members on the ship have tested positive for COVID-19.  All of the crew, except a Japanese translator, are foreign nationals, hailing from about 30 countries. The 86,000-ton Costa Atlantica has no passengers aboard and has been docked in Nagasaki since January 29. It was there for repairs when the first crewman tested positive on Tuesday. Passengers sue cruise lines, alleging COVID-19 negligence While the company that owns the vessel originally said crew members had been confined to the dry dock area around their ship, immigration records have shown dozens disembarked over the last month, and an additional 40 new workers joined the vessel to start their tours of duty. Japan's Self-Defense Forces have been called in to help with testing. The infection cluster is the second such shipboard eruption of cases since 712 passengers and crew were infected two months ago, aboard the  Diamond Princess  cruise ship, in Yokohama.

While the most dramatic outbreak, in the New York City region where more than 15,000 have died, has been slowed, there are many states where the number of new cases is still climbing at or near 10% daily. At the current rate, which shows no sign of changing significantly yet, the U.S. death toll will likely hit 50,000 by Friday evening or Saturday morning.                                                              By Tucker Reals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-24/#post-update-f62b91fe                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       6:17 AM / April 23, 2020              Chinese journalist reappears almost 2 months after being seized amid online reporting from Wuhan                                                            A former state- media news anchor-turned-citizen journalist has reappeared in China after going missing for nearly two months. The 25-year old had posted videos from Wuhan's front lines during the coronavirus outbreak, interviewing residents and filming funeral homes and college campuses.   Re-emerging into public view for the first time since February 26, Chinese journalist Li Zehua said he was detained by police and quarantined because he had visited \"sensitive epidemic areas.\" The last videos he had posted online showed him being chased by a white SUV in Wuhan, then a nearly four-hour YouTube Live stream of himself locked in his apartment, eventually being taken away by people identifying themselves as police.  In a new video posted Wednesday, Li said he was treated well, given three meals each day, was able to watch Chinese news and that the police \"really cared about me.\"  Two other prominent citizen journalists are still missing: Lawyer Chen Qiushi, who interviewed people at Wuhan hospitals during the height of the city's epidemic, and Wuhan native Fang Bin, whose videos of corpses piled up at a Wuhan hospital went viral.                                                                              By Ramy Inocencio                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-24/#post-update-47546942                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       6:00 AM / April 23, 2020              Mitch McConnell says he'd rather let states declare bankruptcy than receive more federal aid                                                            Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday he would rather let state governments declare bankruptcy during the coronavirus pandemic  than receive more federal funding. He suggested Republicans should  oppose additional aid for state and local governments in future  coronavirus relief bills. State governments cannot declare bankruptcy, but radio host Hugh Hewitt asked McConnell  in an interview  Wednesday  if \"we need to invent\" a bankruptcy code so that states facing  financial fallout from the pandemic \"can discharge some of these  liabilities that were put in place by previous governors.\" \"I  would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy  route,\" McConnell replied. \"It saves some cities. And there's no good  reason for it not to be available. My guess is their first choice would  be for the federal government to borrow money from future generations to  send it down to them now so they don't have to do that. That's not  something I'm going to be in favor of.\"  Click here to read more .

The  60-day restriction , which will take effect Thursday night, applies to people overseas seeking to become U.S. permanent residents through petitions filed by their family members or employers in the U.S. The order also pauses the diversity visa lottery, a frequent target of Mr. Trump's ire. Since it restricts family-based immigration, the main way people move permanently to the U.S., the proclamation is expected to block the entry of tens of thousands of people, according to experts.  Read more  here .                                                                              By Camilo Montoya-Galvez                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-24/#post-update-a324eab6                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       5:17 AM / April 23, 2020              New model shows most states should not reopen businesses until end of May                                                            Researchers say most of the U.S. should keep stay-at-home orders until the end of May, later than previously suggested.

Blank check companies typically are publicly traded but have no operations of their own and aim to acquire or merge with others.The two are also combining with sports gambling platform supplier SBTech. The new company will have an initial market value of $3.3 billion.DraftKings co-founder and CEO Jason Robins will remain the head of the merged company. In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, Robins said he believes that the long-term outlook for sports gambling remains strong, and that the company may even benefit from pent-up fan enthusiasm when games return.\"I hope and believe that sports will come back and people will continue to have a strong appetite for sports,\" Robins said. \"If there is a trend away from being outdoors and going to the public places, you could actually see an increase in sports viewership once traditional sports are being played again. You could also see an increase in online activity.\"States with dwindling tax revenues could also turn to sports gambling as a source of funds, Robins said. Since the U.S. Supreme Court lifted a federal ban, 14 states have legalized sports betting in some format. DraftKings operates a sportsbook in eight of them, with its fantasy sports offerings available in 43 states in all.Digital focusRobins noted that the company's digital nature also gives it an advantage in a future where social distancing is more prevalent.\"We don't have a big brick and mortar presence, where a lot of our employees are literally not able to go into work,\" he said.The Boston-based company's 950 employees have all transitioned to working from home, as has Robins. The only time he has gone into the office this month was to record a video for the \"virtual bell-ringing\" to accompany DraftKings' debut on the Nasdaq market under the DKNG stock symbol.The deal announced in December and finalized this week involves $304 million in institutional investments and a Diamond Eagle trust account that contained as much as $400 million. The combined company will have over $500 million of unrestricted cash, DraftKings said.Robins said that the deal's structure protected it from the stock market's swoon triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.

Now for the hard part: Getting what's theirs.Many states around the U.S. have yet to start accepting applications for unemployment insurance benefits from independent contractors, freelancers and other self-employed workers. While some states have yet to even announce when they'll be ready to begin processing their applications, others remain weeks away. Ohio, for instance, estimates it won't be prepared to start accepting claims from the self-employed until mid-May.The delay largely comes down to states needing to create new websites and applications for freelancers to apply for these benefits, given that the typical unemployment site is geared toward serving traditional full- and part-time workers. At the same time, unemployment offices across the country are overwhelmed with a record-breaking 26 million workers who have filed for jobless pay since early March. \"Right now, the traditional unemployment benefit programs in each state are incredibly overwhelmed with claims just from employees,\" said Cheryl Sabnis, a partner at law firm King & Spalding. \"Now you have a lot of work to do in a short period of time and to figure out a way for individuals to actually access the benefits.\"The country had more than 26 million sole proprietors â businesses owned and run by one person, such as consultants, mechanics, freelance writers and artists â according to the most recent IRS data. To be sure, the total universe of gig workers is much larger, with freelancing website Upwork estimating that 57 million Americans are freelancing, either as side gigs or as full-time jobs.Under the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES, Act, self-employed workers now qualify for $600 in weekly Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) benefits through the end of July. Yet the process of applying for these expanded benefits hasn't been easy for many self-employed workers. Some who have been able to apply for PUA benefits in their state say the process is confusing and remain unclear on when, exactly, money will start flowing. \"It is terrifying\"Take Catherine Smith, 33, a travel and food writer who also works in Airbnb management services for homeowners in Philadelphia. When the coronavirus outbreak started spreading across the U.S. in March, her income plunged as publications held off on assignments and travelers canceled their Airbnb rentals in the city.\"There was a conference the weekend of March 20th, and all our reservations â we have dozens of houses â all these houses got canceled,\" she recalled. \"We just started seeing Airbnb pull money from our account.\" Overall, Smith estimates she's lost between 70% to 90% of her income in about a month. \"It is terrifying,\" she said. Smith applied for unemployment benefits through Pennsylvania's Pandemic Unemployment Assistance site after it launched on Saturday. After spending more than 5 hours on the application, she said the site told her to return when the rest of the system was completed. \"It said, 'This part of the site hasn't been finished yet',\" she recalled. \"I go in this loop where I get frustrated and angry. Why they can't just build a system that works? This process shouldn't be this complicated,\" she said.Limiting circumstances It's also unclear how many self-employed workers will qualify for PUA, with some policy experts noting that recent U.S. Labor Department guidance on administering the benefits under the new law could exclude many jobless people. For instance, the rules potentially exclude gig workers, such as Uber drivers, as long as they can still log into their apps and presumably find clients. The CARES Act also limits PUA benefits to certain types of people, including those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or who are caring for family members with the disease, Sabnis noted. But getting tested remains difficult in many states, a hurdle for self-employed workers who want to prove they qualify for the aid, she said.Despite such obstacles, Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation and an expert on unemployment, urged self-employed workers not to give up in trying to enroll for jobless aid. \"I do think that states are working hard to set up the programs,\" he said. \"Be persistent. Keep checking in to see what your state is doing. They will come live over the next period of time, hopefully one week in some states and three weeks in other states.\"Some self-employed workers have had more success than others. Lacey Muszynski, a food and travel writer in Wisconsin, said she applied for PUA benefits on April 21, the first day her state began taking applications. \"It was just a couple online form pages with typical questions about your business, how you make your money and how COVID-19 is affecting it,\" she recounted. But given her state's backlog in unemployment claims, Muszynski doesn't expect to learn whether her application was approved for another couple of weeks. \"Here in Wisconsin the process was pretty straight forward,\" she said, \"although it remains to be seen if they start rejecting applications for not having enough income proof or other reasons related to being self employed.\"", "section": "MoneyWatch", "bylines": ["Aimee Picchi"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "\"It is terrifying,\" one freelancer said of seeing her income plummet while struggling to enroll for jobless benefits.", "originalurl": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/unemployment-benefits-self-employed-gig-worker-freelancer/", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.05393163234072326, "subjectivity": 0.4773623682714591, "wordcount": 856}

In the four weeks ending March 21, egg sales jumped 29% compared with the same period in 2019, the data company said.Wholesale prices for a dozen Midwest large eggs â the benchmark for the egg industry â surged to a record $3.09 on Thursday, up from $1.03 at the beginning of the month, according to Moscogiuri. \"It's essentially tripled over the last three weeks, with retailers seeing demand four-to-six times the normal volume in a very consolidated period,\" the analyst said. \"There are only a certain amount of chickens laying a certain amount of eggs each day, so supply is limited.\" The cost being extracted by egg suppliers is even higher than in 2015, when the industry lost about 11% of its production due to avian influenza killing tens of millions of egg-laying hens, Moscogiuri noted. \"We just got the new egg prices about 10 minutes ago, and it's shocking,\" Avi Kaner, co-founder of Morton Williams, a chain of 16 supermarkets in the New York City metropolitan area, said Friday. \"They raised prices from $2.65 to $3.06, so it's another 15% in the last week, and last week prices doubled from the week before.\"When supplier prices increase, retailers can either pass on the cost to consumers, take a hit to profits or something in between.\"We obviously can't double the price, so we'll increase a little bit,\" said Kaner, who explained that when wholesale egg prices doubled, Morton Williams hiked prices 14%.Prices of other commodities and in-demand products haven't risen quite so sharply, Kaner said. A self-professed believer in supply and demand, he said he objected to egg suppliers \"taking advantage of a national emergency at a time the country should be working to help each other.\" As for the coming holiday, egg decorations may have to be put on the back burner. \"It has begun to look likely that the traditional Easter demand period for shell eggs, now just over a week away, may not materialize with many retailers not issuing circulars and those that are focusing on cage-free and organic offerings which, largely of the brown shell variety, are poor candidates for Easter coloring activities,\" according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's weekly egg report released on Friday. Retailers including Walmart have in recent weeks imposed limits for customers in purchasing items including eggs as well as paper products, milk, cleaning supplies, hand sanitizer, water, diapers, wipes, formula and baby food.CBS News' Irina Ivanova contributed to this report.", "section": "MoneyWatch", "bylines": ["Kate Gibson"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "\"There are only a certain amount of chickens laying a certain amount of eggs each day,\" a commodity analyst warns.", "originalurl": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-panic-shopping-eggs-prices-have-tripled-in-three-weeks/", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": -0.005850468975468976, "subjectivity": 0.4176776695526695, "wordcount": 521}

The presumptive Democratic nominee latched on to Mr. Trump's earlier resistance to grant COVID-19 federal relief money to the postal service, labeling the move \"un-American.\" On April 10, the postmaster general requested help, saying the service was at a \"critical juncture\" and faced a net operating loss of more than $22 billion over the next 18 months. Not financially assisting the postal service, Biden alleged, would be one way the Trump administration could impact proposed expansion of vote-by-mail efforts for the general election.\"Imagine threatening not to fund the post office. Now what in God's name is that about? Other than trying to let the word out that he's going to do all he can to make it very hard for people to vote. That's the only way he thinks he can possibly win,\" Biden said. The former vice president equated the administration's lack of enthusiasm for alternative voting options with the 2016 foreign election interference from Russia. \"I promise you the Russians did interfere in our election and I guarantee you they are doing it again with two other major actors,\" Biden said, adding, \"You can be assured between [Trump] and the Russians there is going to be an attempt to interfere.\"This virtual fundraiser was the former vice president's most celebrity-filled and financially successful event yet. He was joined by a big-name fundraising ensemble including actors Kristin Chenoweth and Billy Porter, tennis legend Billie Jean King, singer Melissa Etheridge and former Democratic rival Pete Buttigieg. The LGBTQ+ event brought together 670 donors raised more than $1.1 million, according to Porter, who served as the Zoom show's energetic emcee. CBS News served as the press pool reporter at the fundraiser; the Biden campaign allows coverage of the usually-private donor events.Wearing a black shirt and circular white glasses that matched the large white fireplace behind him, emcee Porter opened the virtual show with a warning that \"like any self-respecting extravaganza,\" the program might go longer than planned. It lasted around 46 minutes.Porter said he's given his \"own version of the State of the Union speech\" the last two years \"because the thought of me just standing by and not speaking out about what's happening in our country just wasn't an option.\"We need to elect a steady, experienced leader to guide us through this storm and forward. Someone with decency, character and empathy whose own life has taught him to persevere,\" Porter said.\"We need to get to WORK! And put our friends to WORK!\" Porter added, accenting the words.The Tony winner then raised the first Zoom curtain to reveal the first act, singer Melissa Etheridge. Coming from her Zoom window, Etheridge was holding a gold guitar and wearing rose-tinted sunglasses. She introduced her 2013 song \"Uprising of Love\" and said it was an \"anthem for people to rise up against the injustices and the oppression of Putin's anti-LGBTQ regime in Russia.\"\"I don't think we could have possibly imagined then that so much injustice and oppression at the hands of our own government was on the horizon,\" Etheridge added. The singer said it was time to \"rise up\" at the ballot box and elect Biden in November.After the first musical event, Billie Jean King appeared in front of an entire wall of trophies. The tennis star called Biden a \"true leader\" who respects \"facts and science.\"\"As a young athlete Joe, always said 'Give me the ball, give me the ball, coach!''' King said. \"He accepted responsibility as a young person and the most important thing now that we can do is step up and accept responsibility to make sure we are able to tell our children and our grandchildren that we gave all we had to protect the soul of this nation.\"King then served the conversation to Mayor Pete Buttigieg: \"The ball is in your court, Pete.\"Buttigieg listened to Biden's concern about the potential push by Mr. Trump to put off the election. And Biden said the younger politician's future is \"absolutely limitless\" and \"if I have anything to do with it, you're not going to get very far away.\"Biden also said he spoke with another former rival, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, after she announced her brother died of complications from COVID-19.  The finale of the evening belonged to Tony Award winner Kristin Chenoweth.

Eighteen percent said they are undecided.Latino Decisions conducted the national poll of Latinos on behalf of SOMOS Community Care, a New York-area network of physicians serving the region's Latino and Asian immigrant communities. Data from the same poll released last week found that more than 65% of Latinos have lost their jobs or suffered a significant reduction in their incomes as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.SOMOS was co-founded by Henry MuÃ±oz, the former finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a longtime party moneyman who is close to Biden and his senior advisers.There is softer-than-anticipated support for Biden among Latinos because Democrats are \"creating a vacuum\" that reflects a lack of information in the Latino community about how the Trump administration is responding to the crisis, MuÃ±oz said.\"This isn't an ask-people-for-their-vote moment; it's a moment when we should be speaking to Americans about what they're going through and reaching out to them and letting them know that we have their back, because the other party does not, and this president does not,\" he said. \"He is killing us and not testing us and we're losing jobs, and he's taking care of insiders.\"In some parts of the country, Latinos are disproportionately affected by coronavirus, with higher rates of infection, hospitalization and death. In San Francisco, for example, Latinos account for 25% of coronavirus cases, but are just 15% of city residents, Mayor London Breed said Monday.But the poll found generally supportive views for the government's response to the virus. Forty-five percent support how Mr. Trump is handling the pandemic while 55% disapprove. Forty-seven percent of Latinos believe the president \"is providing clear and helpful information about the coronavirus,\" while 50% disagree. Eighty-five percent of respondents agree \"State or local officials have made it clear what I should be doing right now to stop the spread of coronavirus.\" And 81% agreed with the statement, \"We are all in this together and need to do whatever we can to prevent the spread of coronavirus,\" even if it means missing work or school.\"The polling data suggests it has been difficult for Democrats to get their message out. While Trump does not appear to be gaining traction, Latinos appear to be giving him the benefit of the doubt during an unprecedented pandemic,\" said Albert Morales, senior political director of Latino Decisions. \"The good news for Democrats is that they have a presumptive nominee three months sooner than they did in 2016. Enough time to mount an offensive strategy.\"Latino Decisions conducted internal polling of Latino voters for Hillary Rodham Clinton's 2016 presidential bid.Americans prioritize staying home and worry restrictions will lift too fast â CBS News pollMost foresee a country forever changed after coronavirus â CBS News pollBiden currently leads Mr. Trump by single digits in national polls and in surveys released this week of voters in the battleground states of Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Typically, a Democratic presidential candidate needs to earn Latino support at least in the mid-to-high 60% range nationwide to pad a White House victory. Hillary Clinton won 66% of Latino voters in 2016 while Barack Obama won 71% of them in 2012.Biden has a 50% favorable rating among Latinos overall, 24% view him unfavorably. His former Democratic primary rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, has a 54% favorable rating and a 20% unfavorable rating. During this year's Democratic primaries, Sanders trounced Biden among Latinos, especially in Nevada, Texas and California, where a substantial share of the Democratic electorate was Hispanic.MuÃ±oz said Biden's current standing among Latinos reminds him of where Obama was at a similar point during his 2008 presidential bid. But Obama \"had access to messaging platforms, like a convention â the creation of narratives, the storytelling â to let people know who he was and where he stood. And we may not have that this year.\"So what might help Biden? A Latina running mate, the poll finds.Sixty-seven percent of registered Latino voters would be more likely to support him if he picks Cortez Masto for the number two slot; 22% would be less likely to support him. Asked another way, 72% said they would be more likely to turn out and actually vote for Biden if he selected the Nevada senator; 17% would be less likely to do so.The poll did not ask such questions of any other potential vice presidential candidate.Biden told CBS's \"The Late Late Show\" this week that he will formally launch his search for a running mate by May 1, and he has vowed for weeks to select a woman. Several potential picks are reportedly under consideration, including former Democratic primary rivals Senators Kamala Harris, of California; Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, former Georgia State Senator Stacey Abrams and Cortez Masto are also on the list, according to people close to the former vice president.But the poll found that some of Biden's potential choices are widely unknown.Thirty-seven percent of respondents haven't heard of Cortez Masto, 36% haven't heard of Lujan Grisham and Harris is unknown by 25% of respondents. The poll didn't ask about other potential running mates.The survey, conducted April 7 to 12, polled more than 1,200 Latinos nationwide for a margin-of-error of 2.8 percent. Among respondents, 837 are registered to vote and were asked the campaign-related questions for a margin of error or 3.4 percent. The survey was available in English or Spanish; 41 percent answered in Spanish and 59 percent in English.", "section": "Politics", "bylines": ["Ed O'Keefe"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "A new poll of Latinos nationwide indicates Trump's ability to dominate news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic is playing to his advantage with the largest bloc of minority voters.", "originalurl": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-poll-half-latino-voters-president/", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.0641632490316701, "subjectivity": 0.3969497607655503, "wordcount": 1051}

About 20% of the U.S. workers in vulnerable industries facing layoffs are immigrants even though they only make up 17% of the civilian workforce, the Migration Policy Institute said. The economic meltdown has forced many immigrants to branch out to new jobs or adapt skills to meet new demands generated by the virus. Many of the immigrants with new jobs now say they feel grateful to have a job amid the pandemic, even if it means putting their own health at risk.\"I wonder sometimes if I should quit because I don't feel comfortable working, when the virus is everywhere,\" said GarcÃ­a, who now works at a Brooklyn laundromat. \"The problem is that no one knows for how long this will last.\"For Esteva, there was no other option than to find work after she lost her $2,100-per-month salary from a Miami hair salon.

Some immigrants on a temporary work permit, like those applying for asylum, can also get unemployment and the new stimulus checks. Immigrants in the country illegally can't access those dollars even if they pay taxes. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, however, announced that his state will give cash to immigrants living in the country illegally who are hurt by the coronavirus, offering $500 apiece to 150,000 adults. Some cities in the country are pushing similar efforts: Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, have both set up bridge funds that are open regardless of immigration status.

Governors are contemplating unwelcome budget cuts as they wait to see if and when the federal government will provide any relief as their budgets come due in a couple of months.In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo predicted a 20% budget cut for the state's schools, hospitals and local governments. And in Missouri, Governor Mike Parson paused about $227 million in state funding, including a freeze of $61 million that was slated for higher education. In Washington, Governor Jay Inslee has trimmed his spending budget by $235 million. \"These are not easy decisions, and they are not made lightly, but this is the right thing to do to ensure our budget is balanced, and we are financially prepared to deal with the impacts of COVID-19 moving forward,\" Parson, a Republican, said.The immediate cost facing states is twofold: healthcare and unemployment, according to a study by the nonpartisan Center of Budget and Policy Priorities. Because of the pandemic, states have had to ramp up spending on public hospitals, testing and tracing capabilities at the same time they have to pay out record levels of unemployment benefits.Already low rainy-day funds in some states like Louisiana are expected to be depleted soon, and other states, like Minnesota, have been forced to transfer millions from their general funds to their public health emergencies fund.Most of the ambitions that governors had to fulfill the promises of their campaigns have been sidelined for now, as they try to mitigate the impact of their deficits. California Governor Gavin Newsom released a budget in January that aimed to increase school funding, provide health insurance for undocumented immigrants over 65 years old and fix the state's homelessness crisis. In early April, Newsom deemed that budget \"no longer operable.\"\"The world has radically changed since the January budget was proposed, so everything is on the table,\" he said. The CBPP said the collective deficits of states could reach as high as $360 billion, even with the federal assistance provided by the CARES Act and not including any of the medical costs related to fighting COVID-19. While the CARES Act is slated to provide $110 billion in funds to states, it is specifically intended to help offset the coronavirus response efforts, and not to fill any holes in their budgets. \"The White House's refusal to provide more relief to statesâ¦will almost certainly lead many states to cut education and other critical services, including even health care, and to lay off teachers and other workers as states struggle to balance their budgets,\" the CBPP said in a statement.President Trump has been dismissive of some governors' requests for aid, even as he proclaims to have a good relationship with governors like Cuomo and Newsom. He has also claimed, without evidence, that some states have inflated their need for ventilators and other medical supplies.\"Governor Cuomo should spend more time \"doing\" and less time \"complaining\". Get out there and get the job done. Stop talking!\" Mr. Trump said in a tweet last week, after Cuomo argued that the federal government had not done enough to aid New York.Cuomo and Mr. Trump met at the White House on Tuesday. Cuomo told MSNBC after the meeting that he had spoken to the president about states' needs for additional funding. Cuomo said that \"everything's being left to the states to do the reopening, reopening, reopening, and then they don't provide any funding to the state government.\"\"The president seemed very open and understanding of that and said the next piece of legislation that passes, he's going to be open to that,\" Cuomo said.The House and Senate passed interim coronavirus relief legislation this week, which does not provide new funding for state and local governments, but does allow states to use previously allocated funds to offset lost revenues related to the coronavirus. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer expressed frustration on Tuesday that the latest bill did not include assistance for state and local governments, but said that he hoped to address this issue in the next coronavirus response package.Schumer said that he and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would begin working on the next phase of legislation immediately after the House passes the interim package, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell threw cold water on that idea on Wednesday. \"I said yesterday we're going to push the pause button here, because I think this whole business of additional assistance for state and local governments needs to be thoroughly evaluated,\" McConnell said. \"There's not going to be any desire on the Republican side to bail out state pensions by borrowing money from future generations.\"But governors from both parties argue that their needs are dire. On Thursday, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, a Republican, said 80% of her budget is dedicated to healthcare and education, and while her state has always been a \"really thrifty state\" it will still be seeing a substantial tax revenue loss.\"All I really want to do is make sure that I don't have to slash teacher funding, to make sure that I don't have to slash highway maintenance,\" she said. \"I don't want to have to cut funding for nursing homes. But that is situation that they are putting me in. Now that is not conservative.\"Unlike the federal government, 49 states have a deadline to balance their budget, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\"I will remind everyone that we're not the federal government. We can't print money and we have to balance the budget every year, and so our deadline for balancing the budget is June 30, even though many of the payments are going to be extended for individuals until July 15,\" Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, said in March. That deadline is slated for at least the end of May in Illinois, where the state passed a budget in 2019 after going two years without one. Like Newsom, Democratic Governor J.B. Pritzker said \"everything is on the table for consideration\" when it comes to altering the state budget.The Illinois Governor's Office of Management and Budget predicts a $2.7 billion hole in this year's budget, and a $4.6 billion hole in next year's budget, all due to the lost tax revenue caused by the pandemic and the state's stay-at-home order. Before the pandemic, Pritzker was already pushing for a progressive income tax on those who make more than $250,000, which he says is needed \"now more than ever.\"\"We're in a pandemic, we're in an emergency, this crisis is causing a significant disruption to our fiscal year coming up. But we have many years ahead and I think a fairer tax makes sense to me,\" Pritzker said last week.While Illinois House Republican Leader Jim Durkin said the projected deficit in the report could be skewed towards supporting and passing the tax amendment in November, \"there's no doubt that we will be looking at a deficit in the next fiscal year.\" \"We should not be looking at the budget in a way in which we need to increase on top of what we are currently providing to Illinoisans,\" he told CBS News. \"If there ever was a time where the state of Illinois and the legislators have to exercise austerity and responsibility with the tax payer's dollars, it is now.

This week, Congress approved an additional $310 billion for the program. But banking groups say the volume of applications already sent to the Small Business Administration makes it likely that much, if not all, of the new money will go to those already in the queue. Any new applicants would likely miss out on this funding round.\"The majority, if not all, of the funding Congress is considering right now is already exhausted,\" said Nick Simpson, a spokesman with the Consumer Bankers Association.Roughly a third of the new money has been set aside for smaller banks, which may allow a few new applicants to squeeze into the queue. However, small banks have said for the last two weeks that they have been swamped with applications â doing an entire year's worth of loans in a weekend â so it's likely most of that money is now spoken for as well.More than 1.7 million loans were approved in the first round of the program. But the law that created the program has been criticized because it made loans available to large, publicly traded companies like restaurant and hotel chains because the loans were based on workforce size at a company's individual locations. Those loans sapped hundreds of millions of dollars from the pool of funds. The SBA appeared to be approving smaller loans as the first round progressed, an indication that more loans to smaller companies were being approved. As of April 13, the average size of a loan was nearly $240,000 and on April 16 it was $206,000.The loans, which can be up to $10 million, are based on a company's payroll size and offer forgiveness if the money is spent to retain workers or rehire laid-off workers. Many companies that have loans are starting to bring back their staffers, and some states are easing their restrictions on non-essential work, allowing certain businesses to reopen.", "section": "MoneyWatch", "bylines": ["CBS News"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "Thousands of small employers are lining up for new federal funding earmarked for Paycheck Protection Program.", "originalurl": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/paycheck-protection-program-loans-small-business-renewal-gone/", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.06347894529712712, "subjectivity": 0.4101264266036994, "wordcount": 369}

An analysis of 368 patients in veterans hospitals found more deaths among patients who were given hydroxychloroquine than those who received standard care. Hydroxychloroquine also made no difference in the need for a breathing machine, and may be linked to organ damage in some patients.The study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and the University of Virginia, and was posted online without yet undergoing peer review.Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that he wasn't aware of the report when a journalist asked why he had abruptly stopped promoting the drug in recent weeks.\"I don't know of the report,\" he said at a White House briefing. \"Obviously there have been some very good reports and perhaps this one's not a good report â but we'll be looking at it.\"Dr. Rick Bright, the former head of the federal office involved in developing a COVID-19 vaccine, said he was removed from that job for pushing back on the president's promotion of the drug. ", "section": "U.S.", "bylines": ["Jason Silverstein"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "The president called it a \"game changer.\" Now the FDA says it has \"not been shown to be safe.\"", "originalurl": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-fda-warning-hydroxychloroquine-treating-covid-19/", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.13150537634408602, "subjectivity": 0.4980107526881721, "wordcount": 439}

Within days of the Papadopoulos recorded conversation, the FBI Russia team, known as \"Crossfire Hurricane\" had also secured a surveillance warrant for Page to investigate alleged coordination between the Trump team and Moscow.Papadopoulos  is a key figure in the FBI Russia probe. Horowitz found that the bureau opened the case after intelligence received from a friendly foreign government that Papadopoulos \"suggested the Trump team had received some kind of suggestion from Russia that it could assist this process with the anonymous release of information during the campaign that would be damaging to Mrs. Clintonâ¦\"Earlier  this month, CBS News was first to report that transcripts of a separate conversation, on October 31, 2016, showed that Papadopoulos denied to an FBI confidential source that the campaign was involved in the circumstances surrounding the hack of the Democratic  National Committee's email system, calling the idea \"illegal.\"  However,  Horowitz also noted in his report that \"Case Agent 1\" had said of a similar recorded conversation with Papadopoulos in September 2016, \"the Crossfire Hurricane team's assessment was that the Papadopoulos denial was a rehearsed response, and that he did not  view the information as particularly germane to the investigation of Carter Page.\" Case  Agent 1 told the OIG that he and the team had discounted Papadopoulos' denials for a number of reasons, but a footnote to the report said the agent realized in hindsight that the denials, as well as the team's assessment of his denials, should have been shared  with Justice Department's office of intelligence (OI) \"in order for [OI] to make the determination whether [those denials] should be in the application.\"Faulting  the FBI, Horowitz wrote that because the surveillance target has \"no defense counsel,\" there is a special obligation on the FBI and Justice Department to \"over tell\" the story and include a \"full and accurate\" presentation of the facts to meet the bureau's  standard of \"scrupulously accurate.\" Apart  from the serious flaws Horowitz found in the FBI investigation, he said in his report that \"we concluded that the quantum of information articulated by the FBI to open the individual investigations on Papadopoulos, Page, Flynn and Manafort in August 2016  was sufficient to satisfy the low threshold established by the Department and the FBI.\"But  some of Horowitz's findings were disputed by U.S. Attorney John Durham, who is conducting a broader investigation. At the time, Durham said \"we do not agree with some of the report's conclusions as to predication and how the FBI case was opened.\" In  response to the Horowitz report, the FBI has undertaken a broad review of the FISA process, and Director Christopher Wray \"ordered more than 40 corrective steps to address the Report's recommendations.\"", "section": "Politics", "bylines": ["Catherine Herridge"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "Papadopoulos boasts about setting up \"a meeting with...

The state's Attorney General's office has implied that the procedure should be included in the state's directive halting \"non-essential\" medical procedures and conducted an unscheduled inspection of one of the state's three providers.OhioAbortion is available, for now.Currently, there is a temporary restraining order in place that blocks the state from restricting abortion.

But given the court's 5-4 conservative majority, liberals are nervous about how those cases will be decided â and how future issues will be resolved if the balance shifts further after 2021. At the same time, they're also viewing this as a prime  opportunity to press Joe Biden to make his case for the White House by running on the judiciary.In doing so, Biden might galvanize his moderate base and bring along reluctant progressives. It's the same approach used by conservative groups for decades.\"We are about 40 or 50 years behind the conservatives on realizing that a lot of excitement actually happens at the courts,\" Indivisible Project's director of democracy policy Meagan Hatcher-Mays told CBS News. She cited the Supreme Court's recent decision regarding Wisconsin's primary, which effectively forced voters to brave the polls during the COVID-19 pandemic, as a clear example of how the high court's decisions can directly impact lives.Several lawyers and activists told CBS News that Biden, a former public defender, should run on protecting the popular liberal legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Progressives warn if Biden is not elected, the Supreme Court's current 5-4 conservative tilt could balloon into a potential 7-2 majority if Ginsburg, 87, and  Stephen Breyer, 81,  choose to retire or face greater health troubles.This outlook is too grim for voters like twins Tonya and Tiffany Hamilton, 37, who, while waiting in line at Biden's St. Louis rally in March, talked about Ginsburg's cancer treatment. Tiffany Hamilton pleaded, \"All we need is her to hold on until at least November!\"Ginsburg is an enormously popular figure in the Democratic Party, a truth that has been evident throughout the Democratic primary process â her portrait is frequently seen beaming on colorful t-shirts and tote bags. Some suggest that by tying his campaign to protecting her legacy, Biden would also highlight his previous pledge to nominate the first black woman justice if he is elected.There are now calls for Biden to copy the playbook of then-candidate Donald Trump, who in May 2016 released a list of 11 people he would pick from to nominate to take the late Justice Antonin Scalia's seat.Hillary Clinton, the eventual Democratic nominee, did not release a list, since President Barack Obama had already nominated Merrick Garland, whose confirmation the Republican-controlled Senate blocked.Demand Justice, a progressive court reform group, already has a list of several women who they view as qualified, including NAACP Legal Defense Fund Director Sherrilyn Ifill and California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger.Other names floated to CBS News as potential court picks for Biden included federal court judges Kentanji Brown Jackson and Tanya Chutkan, both Obama appointees to the federal bench.\"Clinton and [Tim] Kaine really needed a third person on that ticket to really get out individuals who weren't that excited by them as a team, and I think Joe Biden kind of has the same issue going forward,\" Melissa Murray, law professor at New York University and host of the Supreme Court-focused podcast \"Strict Scrutiny,\" told CBS News. \"Imagine how much more energizing it would be to also pick someone [for SCOTUS] who would excite parts of the Democratic base.\"Polling supports the strategy. Almost two-thirds of Democrats said the court was too conservative, leaving the left's approval rating for the Supreme Court at 38% according to Gallup, the lowest it has been since the end of the Bush administration. Asked about the likelihood of releasing a list of potential appointees, Biden's campaign did not directly respond and highlighted his history with the Supreme Court.\"As chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Joe Biden was proud to oversee and support the confirmation of Justices Ginsburg and Breyer and lead the fight against many Reagan judicial nominees with horrible records on civil rights and civil liberties, like Judge [Robert] Bork. As Vice President, he advised President Obama on the selection of Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, and played a major role in winning their confirmation; Kagan previously served on Biden's staff,\" National Press Secretary TJ Ducklo said in a statement, \"As president, Biden would appoint judges who share his values and would protect the Constitution, and has promised to make history by appointing the first African-American woman to the Supreme Court of the United States.\"More broadly, there are also calls for Biden to outline how he plans to navigate his policy proposals through both a Senate that is unlikely to have a filibuster-proof Democratic majority and a conservative court that could challenge legislation.\"Biden is going to need to have a strategy to deal with the courts in order to get anything done on his agenda,\" Demand Justice executive director Brian Fallon told CBS News.Any Biden administration wins on issues like gun safety, climate change or voting rights are \"going to run head-long into a hostile court based on the 200-plus judges that Donald Trump has confirmed,\" Fallon explained.The specter of conservative resistance is already on the Biden campaign's radar. In a recent letter addressed to the Trump administration and Republican governors, the campaign argued that they should drop their lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act.\"We are all fighting, we are all putting as much energy as possible to getting these progressive reforms passed just to watch the Supreme Court strike them all down,\" Indivisible's Hatcher-Mays added. \"It's not worth the grassroots energy if we know that's going to be the outcome.\"But while Biden seems to be ready to fight over Obamacare, on the trail he has shied away from other progressive ideas to remake the courts and Congress.Elizabeth Warren in her presidential campaign called for the elimination of the Senate's 60-vote filibuster rule, which would lower the bar to pass legislation to a simple majority of 51 votes. And Pete Buttigieg detailed a whole plan to shake up the Supreme Court by adding more justices in an effort to \"depoliticize\" the court.Asked about court reforms like these during his New York Times editorial board interview in January, Biden said he did not support any of them.\"The fact that you're going to amend the Constitution on judicial independence is kind of a stretch,\" he said.", "section": "Politics", "bylines": ["Bo Erickson"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "Progressives say Democrats are half a century behind conservatives on using the issue of judicial nominees to galvanize voters.", "originalurl": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/democrats-push-joe-biden-to-release-supreme-court-short-list-and-run-on-future-court-battles/", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.08119413311194133, "subjectivity": 0.47076652038980793, "wordcount": 1037}

He also announced the FDA is looking at remdesivir, an intravenous drug created to treat Ebola, but would make it available for \"compassionate use,\" a way for doctors to use unapproved drugs to treat patients who are critically ill.CBS News medical contributor Dr. David Agus joined \"CBS Evening News\" to discuss the drugs.1. Hydroxychloroquine is \"hope personified\" for those with COVID-19Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were approved by the FDA more than 50 years ago and are widely available. Dr. Agus told us that if a patient has tested positive for COVID-19, he would advise them to talk to their doctor today about its potential role: \"This drug is hope personified to every person with disease, especially the people who are higher risk or elderly.\"Dr. Agus said the drug works in two ways: \"one is it blocks virus. And the second is it tempers down inflammation, both of which play a role probably in how it's benefiting patients with COVID-19.\"2. People need to be treated \"as early as possible\"In addition to patients who have already tested positive, Dr. Agus advises the drug should be prescribed to people \"as they have symptoms, even before the test results are back,\" or to those who have been exposed to virus. \"If we can intervene early, hopefully we can prevent the spread of this,\" he said.3. There is \"remarkable data\" from other countries about the two drugsWhile the effects of chloroquine and remdesivir on coronavirus have not been fully studied in the U.S., Dr. Agus said countries in Asia \"routinely\" use them, \"and there's remarkable data there about slowing the progress of the disease.\"4. Sacrifices made to stop the spread of COVID-19 \"are going to pay off\"Three days ago the White House issued new guidelines to \"Stop the Spread\" of the virus with social distancing. \"These sacrifices are going to pay off,\" Dr. Agus said. \"I'm optimistic, I'm hopeful with the behavior changes our country has made, as well as with these medications announced today that we're really at a new point and a point where I could see, at some point light at the end of the tunnel.\"5. On the urgent need for blood donations: \"other diseases aren't stopping\"CBS News has learned that more than 4,500 Red Cross blood donations have been canceled since the coronavirus outbreak began, resulting in 150,000 fewer blood donations. Dr. Agus told us that while the coronavirus outbreak is at the top of mind for most people, \"other diseases aren't stopping. People are still getting cancer and have low blood counts and need transfusions people are still getting in car accidents, people still are having the flu and other things and we need to keep the medical system going.

She learned that she had been selected for release to home confinement and filled out her paperwork on April 15 and called her husband of 21 years, John, to share the good news. But by Monday their dream had been taken away from them.\"On Monday first thing in the morning, Leslie calls me, bawling. I know my wife enough to know she was shaking,\" John told CBS News in an interview. \"She said they told her that she had been denied because of the 50% rule now, and they didn't give an explanation.\" The original instruction came on March 26, when Attorney General William Barr directed the Bureau of Prisons to prioritize the use of home confinement for at-risk inmates as a means of curbing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. \"Many inmates will be safer in BOP facilities where the population is controlled and there is ready access to doctors and medical care. But for some inmates, home confinement might be more effective in protecting their health,\" Barr said in the memo, where he listed qualifying variables like the inmate's age, underlying conditions, and the crime for which they were convicted.Later, on April 3, Barr amended his order, asking the Bureau of Prisons to prioritize releasing inmates at some of the hardest hit facilities, the federal correctional institutions in Oakdale,  Louisiana; Danbury, Connecticut and Elkton, Ohio. Up to this point the only offenders disqualified from Barr's directive were sex offenders or those who had committed violent crimes. There was never any specific mention of inmates who had already served at least half their sentence. \"This has been a total disaster and just ripping people's hearts out for no reason, just because of miscommunication between the DOJ and BOP,\" Kevin Ring, the president of Families against Mandatory Minimums, told CBS News. \"The only way to fix this fully now is to let the people out who had been promised release.\"On Wednesday the Bureau sent updated guidance indicating that they are prioritizing inmates \"who only have a relatively short amount of time remaining on these sentences.\"In a court filing made on Thursday in the Southern District of New York, Miami Federal Correctional Institution Associate Warden Jennifer Broton confirmed that the BOP is using its own discretion when identifying which inmates in the federal system can be released to home confinement, according to the attorney general's March 26th directive.  \"BOP is at this time prioritizing for consideration those inmates who either (1) have served 50% or more of their sentences, or (2) have 18 months or less remaining in their sentences and have served 25% or more of their sentences.\"The filing was made in the case of Lewis Stahl, the owner of a medical technology company who had been sentenced to 30 months in prison last year after pleading guilty to tax evasion. Stahl had appealed to the court to be released to home confinement but BOP says that inmates do not have to apply for the placement. As for Leslie Lewis, she still has not been granted the release she was originally promised. \"Somebody ripped away her dreams, it is a crime what they've done,\" her husband John said through tears. \"My wife is the glue to this family... all I got to hear is her crying.\" By Thursday, the Bureau of Prisons reported it had placed 1,501 inmates into home confinement, and 24 federal inmates have died from the coronavirus.

We will collect data. We will continue to ramp up our testing and our tracing.\"The measure immediately replaces one that was scheduled to expire next week. Michigan has nearly 3,000 deaths related to COVID-19, trailing only New York and New Jersey among U.S. states. Whitmer said in the new order that the prior order had been \"effective,\" and \"the strain on our health care system has begun to relent, even as our testing capacity has increased.\"\"Staying home remains our best weapon to defeat this enemy and to stop the spread,\" Whitmer said.Social distancing measures will remain in place. People are now required, rather than encouraged, to wear face coverings in enclosed public spaces such as grocery stores if they can medically tolerate it. Employers must provide non-medical grade masks to their in-person employees.Landscapers, lawn-service companies, plant nurseries and bike repair shops can resume operating, subject to social-distancing rules. Stores selling nonessential supplies can reopen for curbside pickup and delivery. Big-box retailers no longer have to close off garden centers and areas dedicated to selling paint, flooring and carpet.Whitmer said people with multiple in-state homes can resume traveling between them, though it is strongly discouraged. All other travel is still banned, including travel to vacation rentals.\"The vast majority of people in this state are doing the right things. We've seen the curve get pushed down,\" the Democratic governor told The Associated Press. \"I think it's appropriate to reevaluate along the way. At this point we feel like's good to have our first wave of reengagement in this way.\"The order continues to prohibit in-person work that is not necessary to sustain or protect life, with exemptions for various critical jobs. Restaurants remain closed to dine-in customers under a separate measure, and bars, movie theaters, gyms and other sports facilities also are still shuttered.The prior stay-home order â in tandem with guidance issued by Whitmer's office â prompted lawsuits on behalf of anglers, landscaping companies, cottage owners and others. Republicans who control the Legislature also criticized it and plan to vote Friday to limit her emergency powers despite a certain veto. Conservative demonstrators held a large rally at the state Capitol last week, and a much smaller protest took place Thursday outside the governor's residence in Lansing.Whitmer defended the previous order, which she issued April 9 and was stricter than one that took effect March 24. Imposing some of the country's toughest restrictions, she said, was necessary because of what were rapidly rising cases and deaths that threatened to overwhelm hospitals.\"Michigan's COVID-19 experience was tougher than just about any other state,\" said Whitmer, whose moves have been backed by health experts and in public polling.Landscaping and more outdoor activities, she said, were \"naturally parts of our economy that we could move forward on\" now. While golfing is allowed, the use of carts is not. State parks will generally remain open, and people already were allowed to run, walk, hike and ride bikes.Whitmer said her administration is talking with medical and business experts to assess different jobs and industries for risk, to promulgate safety protocols and to determine \"markers\" that need to be reached before reopening additional sectors. The order does not explicitly address Detroit-area automakers' ability to restart plants. It continues to list \"transportation and logistics\" and \"critical manufacturing\" as sectors where some employees can go to work. Talks continue between the Detroit Three and the United Auto Workers union.\"This is one of what will be many waves,\" Whitmer said. \"My hope is that we can contemplate the next one.

Doctors say absolutely not", "bodytext": "Several members of the Cuomo family have been in the news recently, and every story has to do with the coronavirus. Weeks after CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, brother of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, tested positive for COVID-19, he announced that his wife, Cristina Greeven Cuomo, tested positive as well. Cristina Greeven Cuomo runs a health and wellness site called \"The Purist,\" where she blogged about her unusual regimen while battling the virus, including bathing in a bleach solution. She said she decided to give it a try as a \"more affordable\" alternative to an IV vitamin drip to purportedly \"neutralize heavy metals\" in the body.\"While IVs are subject to cost and are not cheap (a vitamin drip ranges around $300 whereas a hospital will charge thousands of dollars for them and for medication that has no proven studies behind them), I wanted to try a more affordable way I heard about to neutralize heavy metals: take a bath,\" Cuomo writes.She writes that Dr. Linda Lancaster suggested a bath with \"a nominal amount of bleach,\" and explained that the idea is to \"combat the radiation and metals in my system and oxygenate it.\" Cuomo says since she had no sense of smell or open cuts, she decided to try it. \"So, I add a small amountâ1/4 to 1/2 cup ONLYâof Clorox to a full bath of warm water (80 gallons),\" she writes.However, many doctors advise against trying this and warn in stark terms that it could be dangerous. In an email to CBS News, microbiologist Dr. Dean Hart said bathing in bleach is a bad idea. \"While us in science do not like to speak in absolutism, I have never heard, ever, of a bleach bath being recommended for the treatment of any disease,\" Hart said. \"Don't do that. It is not a good idea, in fact, it's a bad idea. It could hurt you. The air becomes toxic around a bleach or chlorine bath. This has the potential to be very harmful, whether you are observing through your skin or breathing.\"Hart said while bleach is useful in the clothes-washer and chlorine disinfects swimming pools, it's not meant for the body.\"Dense bleach could kill you. I have never heard of this before and would not recommend it,\" he said.For people wondering how to treat coronavirus symptoms, Dr. Hart says simply: \"Stay home. Sleep. Drink lots of fluids. Take Tylenol.\" Call a doctor if more severe symptoms develop.Dr. Sachin Nagrani, M.D., the medical director at telehealth company Heal, said there's one situation where a diluted bleach bath might be useful: \"There is some evidence that chronic eczema may benefit from bathing with a small quantity of bleach diluted in water (around Â¼ cup bleach in 40 gallons),\" Nagrani told CBS News via email. However, Nagrani added, \"bathing with bleach is not shown to benefit any other condition, and ingesting or injecting bleach is dangerous.\"The CDC does recommend diluted household bleach solutions to clean and disinfect some surfaces, and the EPA has compiled a list of disinfectants for use against COVID-19 â as household cleaners, not treatments. \"When using an EPA-registered disinfectant, follow the label directions for safe, effective use,\" the EPA states. \"Never apply the product to yourself or others. Do not ingest disinfectant products. This includes never applying [disinfectants] directly to food.\"On Thursday, President Trump sparked backlash from the medical community when he floated the idea of using disinfectants to treat coronavirus.The president said he'd seen a demonstration of \"the disinfectant where it knocks it [coronavirus] out in a minute,\" and continued: \"And is there a way you can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning? As you see, it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs â so it'll be interesting to check that. ... It sounds interesting to me.\" Asked about it again on Friday, the president claimed he was being sarcastic.The maker of Lysol put out a statement saying \"under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route).\" And U.S. Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams also warned against self-medicating: \"A reminder to all Americans- PLEASE always talk to your health provider first before administering any treatment/ medication to yourself or a loved one.   Your safety is paramount, and doctors and nurses are have years of training to recommend what's safe and effective,\" Adams tweeted", "section": "Health", "bylines": ["Caitlin O'Kane"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "Cristina Greeven Cuomo raised many eyebrows when she said she took a bleach bath while battling coronavirus.", "originalurl": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cristina-cuomo-bleach-bath-clorox-treat-covid-19-symptoms-doctors-say-absolutely-not-coroanvirus/", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.09321338383838385, "subjectivity": 0.5031791125541126, "wordcount": 738}

There is no way we could have known it would be critical to our survival,\" said Edelman of Poulet Sans TÃªte, or chicken without a head, launched in late 2018 with his business partner Micheline Gaulin.The chicken-on-the-run service has expanded as all but essential businesses closed to curb the spread of the coronavirus, while the pair's main venture â a casual fine-dining restaurant called Left Bank in in the city's West Village neighborhood â quickly shuttered after nine years. \"We had a really big dip in revenue â about 95%,\" Edelman explained.Edelman and his partner had employed around two dozen people as servers and cooks, and are now down to themselves and two others, who prepare and sell about 30 chickens a day, along with sides, sauces and sandwiches. That's up from the pre-pandemic volume of between 12 and 20 of the cooked birds.  What started as a popup venture \"became something that can grow, in a very twisted and ironic sense,\" Edelman said. \"We were really lucky to have a delivery-only concept ready to go. Now that we're a month in, that 's all we do now.\"The business upheaval amid the respiratory disease that's killed more than 50,000 Americans as of Friday morning has also led Edelman to pitch in by delivering meals to feed doctors and nurses and other workers at New York City hospitals, funded by donations made by those ordering his chicken online. \"We're giving our customers the opportunity to donate a meal to a hospital worker for $10,\" he said, noting that the idea was inspired by a customer who made a catering order for $350 to be delivered to nearby Lenox Hill Hospital, \"out of the goodness of his heart.\"In three weeks, Edelman has delivered 455 meals to hospital workers, with another 226 covered by more than $7,000 in donations.\"At first I was just showing up with food, now I have a contact and things are more organized,\" he said of his twice-weekly trips to medical centers.

Deng was diagnosed with the coronavirus disease several days after being sent home from work. On Thursday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called on Smithfield to make substantial changes at its Sioux Falls plant, which is linked to hundreds of local COVID-19 cases and at least two deaths.Other meat companies around the U.S. are also contending with infected workers. In addition to having to close its slaughter operations in Sioux Falls, Smithfield has also shuttered a plant in Martin City, Missouri, and in Cudahy, Wisconsin. The company â a wholly owned subsidiary of China's WH Group â on Friday said it would suspend operations starting next week and until further notice at its meat-processing plant in Monmouth, Illinois, after a \"small portion of its 1,700 employees tested positive for COVID-19.\" The facility produces about 3% of U.S. fresh pork supplies, and also makes bacon.Tyson Foods on Wednesday shut down its large pork processing plant in Waterloo, Iowa, after multiple employees tested positive for the virus. It's also shuttering a poultry processing plant in Temperanceville, Virginia, for cleaning during the weekend. Tennessee officials this week reportedly said 120 workers from a Tyson plant in Goodlettsville tested positive for COVID-19. Approximately 1,600 people work at the plant. JBS USA, a subsidiary of JBS SA, the world's largest meat producer, closed its Greeley, Colorado, facility. A Hormel Foods plant in Rochelle, Illinois, was shut Monday by the Ogle County Health Department after cases among employees doubled to 30 within a week. The county tested more than 600 workers on Thursday, and plans to test the remaining 200 to 300 people on Friday. Hormel agreed to continue paying and covering health benefits for the as many as 900 employees furloughed by the closure.Separately, Hormel on Friday said it would pause operations at two Jennie-O Turkey Store facilities in Willmar, Minnesota, after 14 employees tested positive for COVID-19.

But in Thursday's coronavirus task force briefing from the White House, President Trump touted two preexisting treatments that have been floated as potential ways to help patients fight back.Both drugs are still in clinical trials for coronavirus. But CBS News medical contributor Dr. David Agus joined \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Norah O'Donnell to break down what we know about the medications.Read Norah O'Donnell's interview with Dr. Agus below. Norah O'Donnell: Dr. David Agus, so good to have you. One of the drugs is actually a half-century-old anti-malaria drug. How does it work?  Dr. David Agus: It's pretty wild, right? Hydroxychloroquine is used for malaria and rheumatoid arthritis, and it works by two mechanisms: One is it blocks virus, and the second is it tempers down inflammation â both of which play a role probably in how it's benefiting patients with COVID-19. The other drug that the president mentioned was created to treat Ebola. How would that work? So that is another antiviral. This one is intravenous â compared to the first one, hydroxychloroquine, is oral â and remdesivir is an intravenous drug that blocks the virus. You know, this is a virus, it's not alive. The virus actually goes into our cells and uses our own machinery to divide, and drugs like remdesivir can inhibit those processes, enabling the virus to stop dividing, and that's how we benefit from it.   If you have COVID-19 right now, what do these potential treatments mean for you? If somebody has COVID-19 now, I want them to talk to their doctor about the potential role of using hydroxychloroquine today. It is an FDA-approved drug for other indications and they could write a prescription today for this drug and use it in the right setting. That doesn't mean every patient needs to be on it, but it's a discussion to have with your doctor, there is hope. And this drug is hope personified to every person with the disease. We saw cases spike in just the last 24 hours. Where are we on this curve? I'm optimistic. I'm hopeful with the behavior changes our country has made, as well as with these medications announced today, that we're really at a new point and a point where I could see, at some point, light at the end of the tunnel.  What's the most significant behavioral changes you've made? You know, my children and my wife, we're staying home, and we're going out for things like this where it's a very controlled environment, we're eating together as a family. Both of my children are home from college, and every night I have dinner with them.

Georgia on Friday let employers including hair salons and restaurants begin admitting customers, while Alaska, Oklahoma and Texas are discussing reopening strategies. Many other states' stay-at-home orders expire at the end of April.Yet those states and the vast majority of others do not yet meet the criteria to start loosening coronavirus-related restrictions safely, according to research by health care analysts at investment banking company Raymond James. Just four of 50 states meet all of the White House's criteria to begin a phased reopening, Raymond James wrote. Those are Kansas, Montana, Washington and Wyoming. The findings are based on the guidance suggested in the White House's reopening plan, which are called \"gating criteria.\" That plan recommends (but does not require) that states hold off on reopening non-essential businesses until they see a 14-day decline in flu-like illnesses and positive COVID-19 tests; hospitals can treat all patients; and there is a \"robust testing program\" that includes antibody testing that can confirm whether someone has been exposed to the coronavirus.Michigan and New Jersey are the least prepared to thaw out their business sector, meeting none of the White House's criteria, according to Raymond James analysts. Most states have met one or two of the points needed to start reopening. But even that might be overstating their readiness, according to the investment bank.   \"Notably, although a few states are green per this analysis, none are truly ready according to the 'Opening Up America Again' criteria as many do not have widespread antibody testing available,\" the analysts wrote. Antibody testing can reveal how many people in a given area have been exposed to COVID-19 and who might be immune to the illness. It's seen as particularly important because many people infected with the coronavirus do not show symptoms. (A recent sample test of people in New York state revealed that 2.7 million residents may have been exposed statewide, about 10 times the number who have tested positive for COVID-19.) Georgia, notably, is among the less-prepared states, according to the Wall Street analysts, who point out that the number of confirmed tests of COVID-19 in the state has grown by an average of 15% per day in the last two weeks.\"Georgia scores in the top 50% of states who should not reopen,\" they wrote, noting that \"the state's symptom position leaves much to be desired.\"A separate study from the Dartmouth Atlas recently found that cases of COVID-19 are growing fastest in states that are considering reopening soon, including those in the South and Midwest. \"We need to be aware that this epidemic is far from over,\" said the study's author, Dr. Elliott Fisher, a professor of health policy and medicine at The Dartmouth Institute, adding, \"The number of cases in every region today are higher than they were a week ago.\"While relatively small groups of protestors in some states are clamoring for public health guidelines to be lifted, claiming it would revive local economies, most Americans are prioritizing health concerns, a CBS News poll reveals.Nearly two-thirds of the survey respondents said they were more worried about the economy reopening too quickly and worsening the virus outbreak, while just one-third was more concerned about reopening to slowly. Nearly half said they would not leave their house until the pandemic ended even if local stay-at-home orders were lifted, There are numerous potential risks to states prematurely reactivating their economies.

The only prevention is ozone. #coronavirus #ozonetherapy.\" Another read,  \"Corona Virus update: ozone eradicates lethal viruses and bacteria. #coronavirus #ozonetherapy.\" In a recorded phone call earlier this month, Jean Allen, the owner of Purity Health, told a prospective customer that there was a COVID-19- positive patient in the facility for treatment.\"When asked how Defendants would stop the transmission of the virus given that patient's positive diagnosis, Defendants offered as the only protective measure the purported fact that ozone would sanitize everything,\" court documents say. At the time of publication, there was no attorney of record for Purity Health and Wellness Centers or Allen.\"Victims suffer financial losses from the wire fraud scheme facilitated by Defendants, and victims further suffer harm via potential exposure to COVID-19 by unnecessarily visiting Purity Health's location for a treatment that does not work,\" the complaint says.Last week, prosecutors took similar action against a chiropractor who was advertising homeopathic remedies that would provide \"up to 90 percent protection\" against COVID-19. Ray Nannis was touting the products as an effective COVID vaccine and treatment produced by his company, Optimum Wellness Solutions.\"As I've mentioned before, we do have a homeopathy,\" Nannis told viewers in an April 1 video posted to his company's Facebook page. \"It works as, based on history of over 20 years, on dealing with viruses that are very similar,\" he said. \"It can help the body up to 90% deal with what's going on with the body. What it does is it gives the body an immunological and a neurological recognition of the energy, of the frequency of a virus, and this specific one being the coronavirus.\"In a phone conversation with a U.S. Secret Service special agent, Nannis said that \"if someone became infected with the novel Coronavirus and/or COVID-19, the homeopathy he was offering would minimize any associated symptoms.\" He then offered to sell the product to the agent for $95 per dose and said he would ship it directly if the agent provided his credit card information, according to the complaint. While Nannis said he could not call his product a \"cure\" because of FDA restrictions, he said that it nonetheless \"basically\" was one \"for all intents and purposes,\" according to the U.S. attorney's office. At this time, there are no products approved by the FDA that prevent or treat COVID-19.The court granted the temporary restraining order against Nannis and Optimum Wellness Solutions, and ordered that he \"immediately cease offering to treat, cure, prevent, or otherwise mitigate the impact of the novel Coronavirus or COVID-19, including, in particular, in connection with any 'homeopathy' or 'homeoprophylactic.'\"Nannis' lawyer did not immediately respond to request for comment.Earlier Friday, President Trump sought to clarify the comments he made at the Coronavirus task force briefing the day before, in which he mused about the possibility of a cure. \"And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute,\" the president said Thursday. \"One minute.

The change comes as the coronavirus pandemic upended the political world, ending traditional campaign rallies, causing primaries to be conducted entirely by mail, and even putting the fate of the national convention into question. \"We pride ourselves for having the largest convention in the country,\" said Texas Democratic Party deputy executive director Cliff Walker. \"It's the biggest gathering of Democrats outside of the DNC (Democratic National Convention). But now that we're having to make some adjustments, I think it really does give us some opportunities.\"As the coronavirus spread nationally in March, party leaders realized they might not be able to hold their customary convention, with thousands of Texans packed into a San Antonio convention center in early June, and they started looking at ways to reinvent the event for 2020 and beyond. The party announced the decision to transform its in-person convention into a virtual one in March, but is sharing details of how it will execute the plan for the first time. \"We firmly believe that this is the future of what conventions can look like,\" said Texas Democratic Party convention director Hannah Roe Beck.The party plans to hold its virtual convention during the first week of June using two channels: One for official party business like voting on delegates and one with speakers, performances, and panels. The party is still in talks with the production company and the speakers about the locations for the broadcast events, but the idea is to build a TV studio and control room to deliver the feed.  According to convention organizers, the \"main stage\" channel with speakers and panels will be broadcast on social media platforms such as Facebook. The party business will be conducted on a video chat platform like Zoom that will feature a grid of video boxes and allow participants to interact and ask questions. For voting on delegates and other party business, the state party has built out a system using Google Forms to insert preferences. Voting will be divided up across multiple days, instead of the traditional one to two days of voting, so that users with varying technological equipment and expertise have the time to participate. Party officials said there will be testing and extensive training on the process ahead of the convention. FROM THE CANDIDATESJOE BIDENTomorrow is the one-year anniversary of Biden announcing his primary campaign. Earlier today, Biden and the Democratic National Committee officially joined fundraising arms to form the \"Biden Victory Fund.\" A DNC official told CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice the max donation to the Biden fund will be $360,600 and noted a fundraising partnership with state parties is in the works. Regarding fundraising, CBS News also confirmed with a Biden campaign official today that the campaign returned a max donation of $2,800 from comedian Louis C.K. The actor was accused of sexual misconduct in November 2017.Late last night Joe Biden predicted President Trump would try to push back November's general election in an effort to help the president win, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. \"Mark my words, I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held,\" Biden said during a Thursday evening virtual fundraiser. The presumptive Democratic nominee latched on to Mr. Trump's earlier resistance to grant COVID-19 federal relief money to the postal service, labeling the move \"un-American.\" Biden said, \"Imagine threatening not to fund the post office. Now what in God's name is that about? Other than trying to let the word out that he's going to do all he can to make it very hard for people to vote. That's the only way he thinks he can possibly win.\" Biden's star-studded, energetic fundraiser netted more than $1.1 million dollars.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMPA digital technology company that specializes in the mass collection of smartphone location data and is working for President Donald Trump's re-election campaign received millions from the federal coronavirus relief fund for small businesses, CBS News senior reporter Stephen Gandel and CBS News investigative reporter Graham Kates report. The company, Phunware, helped develop the \"Trump 2020\" campaign app, a tool over a year in the making and launched just yesterday. Home to 60 employees, the company was eligible for the low-interest loan through the Paycheck Protection Program, which is aimed at businesses with less than 500 workers. There is no allegation of illegality associated with its loan. But the size of the loan â $2.85 million â is nearly 14 times the current PPP average of $206,000. Meantime, hundreds of thousands of smaller businesses got nothing, because the nearly $350 billion loan program ran out of money in just two weeks. (Congress is allocating another $310 billion to the PPP loan fund this week.) The speed of Phunware's loan is notable, too. The publicly traded Texas-based company named a high-profile former Wall Street executive as its corporate board chair on March 30, the day after the PPP program was passed by Congress as part of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act. Phunware has not disclosed how much it expects to make from the Trump campaign this year. But the company has said in filings it is actively pursuing political work during the 2020 presidential election cycle. A spokesperson for the Trump 2020 campaign did not reply to questions sent for this article.Asked about the impact of the coronavirus on the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga says President Trump told reporters Thursday, \"I can't tell you what's going to happen in an election.\" Trump took aim at presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, calling him \"a sleepy guy in the basement of a house.\" The president said he looks forward to debating the former vice president, adding that, \"they're keeping him sheltered because of the coronavirus.\" Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale echoed these comments in an interview Thursday evening, suggesting Biden \"doesn't want to be in those debates.\"Parscale told Fox News, \"Even if it's only the president and him 12 feet apart, with nobody in the crowd. He still doesn't want to do it because he doesn't want to be caught in those situations. I mean the man in the last few months has forgot what date it was, what year September 11th happened.\" Mr.  Biden has repeatedly said he plans to debate Trump either virtually or in person if safe enough. Parscale also dismissed recent polls showing the president is running behind in Michigan and Florida. \"I'm not worried about this one state,\" he said. \"I think we have new states like New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, Minnesota in play.\" The campaign manager added he is \"not worried\" about any of Biden's potential vice presidential picks, including Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. \"I completely think in Michigan, it'll help us. I think she has done everything wrong for that state,\" Parscale said of the Democratic state executive.VEEPSTAKESELIZABETH WARRENSenator Elizabeth Warren on Friday called for an investigation into whether banks have been unfairly prioritizing larger clients as they've issued federal loans meant to help small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program. \"Based on the last update provided by the SBA, the largest 4% of loans approved under the program cost over $150 billion â and accounted for 45% of all program funding, a clear sign that mom and pop businesses did not proportionally benefit from the program,\" Warren and Rep. Nydia VelÃ¡zquez wrote in a letter to inspectors general of the Small Business Administration and Treasury Department. CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak says the Democratic lawmakers cited several news reports about banks prioritizing bigger customers and about businesses receiving aid despite laying off most of their employees. Warren and VelÃ¡zquez asked the agencies to review the banks' process for granting loans and whether the companies receiving them were in need and if they had ties to the Trump administration. GRETCHEN WHITMERMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed an executive order on Friday morning that will extend the stay at home order in Michigan through May 15, notes CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. The current stay-at-home order expires at the end of the month. While the stay-at-home order is extended, Whitmer's executive order eases some restrictions. Landscapers, plant nurseries and bike repair and maintenance shops may operate with strict social distancing measures enforced. In addition, motorized boating and golfing may resume with social distancing rules being practiced. The executive order also noted that employers must provide their employees who perform in-person tasks a non-medical grade mask. People who are in enclosed public spaces will also be required to wear a face covering, such as scarves, handkerchiefs or bandanas, to cover their nose and mouth if they can medically tolerate it. In a briefing Friday morning, Whitmer said the executive order is a \"step forward, but added that the overarching message on how to combat the coronavirus remains the same. \"Staying home remains our best weapon to defeat this enemy and to stop the spread,\" she said. Hours later, the Republican controlled state senate passed two bills that would limit Whitmer's emergency powers. In her briefing, Whitmer threatened to veto the legislation. \"I'm not going to sign any bill that takes authority away from me, or from any future governor,\" Whitmer said. \"The powers of the executive office are incredibly important, especially in times of crisis where lives are on the line.\" Michigan's legislature also adopted a bipartisan oversight committee to examine the state's response to the coronavirus pandemic. GOVERNOR'S MANSIONHELP WANTEDAccording to audio obtained by CBS News, several governors stressed the need for state funding during a call on Friday about testing with Vice President Mike Pence and members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said he's had to spend $36 million on a combination of testing, which is money he had to front using the state's general funds. \"If there's no help for the state, then we're left to go bankrupt. That's the money we're using to do the testing,\" Walz said on the call. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell previously floated allowing states to go bankrupt while Congress hits the \"pause button\" on any further funding to the states. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has slammed McConnell's comments in his press briefings, and during the call said that a clear show of support from Trump would help the governors \"speak in the voice of solidarity and to do our jobs.\" Cuomo added, \"Because if we have to start to push back against this, it's not going to be an easy situation for any of us.\" In response, Pence referenced Trump's prior comments about having \"an openness to another bill, an openness to state support.\" The call for state aid comes as governors across the aisle are concerned about any future cuts they might have to make, reports CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro and CBS News digital political reporter Grace Segers.During the call, the governors also gave updates on their testing capabilities, sharing some of the ways they've worked with public and private laboratories. Cuomo said the \"delineation of responsibility\" on testing between the federal and state governments is clearer, with the federal government handling issues with the national supply chains and the states handling their labs. \"So the national manufacturers, the reagents, the test kits, the international supply chain, whatever those issues are, the federal government could facilitate that up to the national manufacturers. Then our labs in our states could actually get the supplies from the national manufacturers so our labs produce whatever they can produce,\" he said. \"It's not the states on their own, and it's not the federal government running the show. It's an absolute partnership,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci added.KEY CONSTITUENCIESLATINO VOTEAre the daily presidential news briefings on Coronavirus â and the near-constant coverage of President Trump's words and actions in response to the pandemic â giving him a campaign advantage? A new survey out today suggests it might be with a critical bloc of support for Democrats, according to CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe. Just 49% of Latino registered voters would vote for former Vice President Joe Biden while another 10% said they were undecided but leaning towards backing him, according to the poll by Latino Decisions. Seventeen percent of respondents said they back Mr. Trump, with another 6% undecided but leaning in his direction. Eighteen percent said they are undecided. The poll was conducted on behalf of Henry MuÃ±oz, the former finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a longtime party moneyman who is close to Biden and his senior advisers. There is softer-than-anticipated support for Biden among Latinos because Democrats are \"creating a vacuum\" that reflects a lack of information in the Latino community about how the Trump administration is responding to the crisis, MuÃ±oz said. \"This isn't an ask-people-for-their-vote moment; it's a moment when we should be speaking to Americans about what they're going through and reaching out to them and letting them know that we have their back, because the other party does not, and this president does not,\" he said. \"He is killing us and not testing us and we're losing jobs, and he's taking care of insiders.\" What might help Biden? Picking a Latina running mate, the poll finds.

Grove is asking Newsom to allow some parts of the state to end lockdowns ahead of more afflicted areas. Grove said the rate of spread across communities has been different, adding, \"many counties have in fact only had a handful of cases.\" According to an analysis from the Los Angeles Times, Kern County, which encompasses Bakersfield, has 699 confirmed cases of coronavirus. In contrast, neighboring Los Angeles County has reported over 17,000 confirmed positive cases. Grove said \"it does not make sense to indefinitely bind\" different areas as part of the same statewide lockdown and urged Newsom to grant city and county governments \"more flexibility and discretion\" when it comes to ending shelter-in-place mandates.Meanwhile the California Republican Party is asking Newsom to prohibit campaign operatives and volunteers from collecting mail-in ballots from voters at their homes. The practice, referred to as ballot harvesting, is legal and allows any person to collect a mail-in ballot from voters and turn it in to a polling place or the registrar's office. Prior to 2016, the law restricted this practice to just relatives of or those living in same household as the voter. The California Republican Party says it has not heard back from Newsom after sending him a letter nine days ago to prohibit this practice because it presents the same risk as in-person voting. The letter argues that the practice of ballot harvesting, which may involve a stranger visiting a voter's home and returning that voter's ballot to the election offices, would be a threat to the safety of others. In a statement to CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Newsom \"needs to make clear that ballot harvesting stands in direct conflict with the stay-at-home order he issued.\" And in a tweet this morning, McDaniel renewed the calls to prohibit the practice of ballot harvesting ahead of California's special election, adding, \"Gov. Gavin Newsom has been dodging this all week.\" Newsom's office did not respond to a request for comment from CBS News. WISCONSINHundreds of Wisconsinites descended on the state capitol building in Madison on Friday to call on Governor Tony Evers to reopen the state. CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster reports many of the speakers said Wisconsin's stay-at-home order was an infringement on civil liberties and hurting the economy. Attendees waved American flags and some wore shirts or flew flags supporting President Trump. Live videos streaming on Facebook showed many people were not wearing masks and some appeared to not follow social distancing guidelines. The protest and rally came the same day that Wisconsin's extended safer at home order took effect. The order, which goes through May 26, keeps some businesses closed, but lifts some restrictions such as allowing \"non-essential businesses\" to do \"Minimum Basic Operations,\" including deliveries and curbside pickup. Golf courses are also allowed to open. Republican leaders in the legislature have asked the Wisconsin Supreme Court to block that order. On Monday, Evers released a plan to reopen the state in three phases based on a 14-day downward trend in coronavirus cases and increasing testing capabilities, improving contact tracing and ensuring enough hospital capacity. An Ipsos poll released on Wednesday found that 68% of registered Wisconsin voters approve of how Evers has handled the coronavirus pandemic and 67% believe the local response to the virus is going well. While the protest was happening, Wisconsin reported 304 new positive COVID-19 cases and five more deaths from the virus. It was the highest increase of cases the state has reported in a single day.

Elective medical procedures can also resume. By Monday, movie theaters may resume selling tickets, and restaurants that had been limited to takeout orders could return to limited dine-in service.As part of the state's reopening safety guidelines, cosmetology workers are required to wear personal protective equipment and can consider providing masks and other PPE to clients.

As a doctor, I knew he was working hard to breathe. The medical terms used to describe respiratory distress - seesaw breathing, nasal flaring, grunting, retracting, tachypneic - he had them all. As a mom, it was torture watching him struggle.\"At the height of his illness, Zimmerman said her son's coughing spells were constant and terrifying. He lost the desire to eat and drink entirely, and he slept for the vast majority of the day and night.\"He was probably sleeping 20 to 21 hours a day,\" she told CBS News. \"You know, he would wake up for a couple hours in the morning and maybe an hour in the afternoon, but otherwise he was just sleeping. He couldn't eat. All of his energy was going into breathing. And that was pretty scary to watch.\"Initially, she said, Lincoln's timeline didn't seem consistent with COVID-19, and neither did his tests. He had had mild symptoms for a week before spiking a fever. His chest x-ray presented like a run-of-the-mill respiratory virus. His CBC blood test didn't show the low white blood cell count or low lymphocyte count that most pediatric COVID-19 patients get.But two days later, she said, things took a turn for the worse when she got the news that no parent wants to hear: Lincoln's coronavirus test had come back positive.\"It was definitely baffling when they said his test came back positive for COVID,\" she said. \"Literally, the things that run through your mind are: How? Why? When? Where? What?! Where could it have come from? And you start going through every little thing that you did. I honestly don't know what the exposure was because nobody that we were around was sick, which means the exposure probably came from some asymptomatic person. We did walk around the block. So, could he have stuck his fingers in the mud and then picked his nose? Yes, absolutely. He's a 4-year-old boy. But honestly, I just don't know.\"Zimmermann said she cried for nearly four hours the night her son was diagnosed. She said she couldn't sleep and her heart broke hearing Lincoln vocalize his pain.\"'Mama, this isn't worth it,'\" she recalled him saying. \"Mama, when is this going to stop? Mama, I don't feel so good. Mama, it is no use. Mama, I'm not gonna go home.\"The reassuring texts she had been receiving from coworkers also dried up, she said, as her fellow doctors ran out of ways to spin the situation in a positive light.\"I was talking with one of the physicians I work with,\" Zimmermann said. \"And you know, when Lincoln first got sick and had a fever, he would say, 'It's not going to be COVID. There's so many other viruses out there right now.' 'Well, even if it is COVID, kids do really well with COVID.' 'Well, even though you're in the hospital, you're only on two liters.' You know, like trying to give me all these positive reassuring texts. And that Wednesday and Thursday, he told me later, 'Yeah, I didn't have any positive reassuring texts to send back' because we all knew how sick Lincoln was, but nobody was really saying how sick he was. He just kept going up on support. Up and up and up and up.\"The isolation took its toll on Lincoln's family, too.\"It was really hard when you're going through a hospital stay with your child to not be able to give your husband a hug or give your daughters a hug â and not only reassure them, but have that comfort that you're used to having in stressful situations,\" Zimmermann said. \"When I get stressed out, my husband gives me a hug. That's really helpful. And we couldn't do that.\"But outside the hospital, the community rallied around her family, she said. His school put together a meal train to deliver nightly dinners to his father and sisters back at home. The family's neighbors dropped off fresh berries at the house and sent Zimmermann a care package with shower wipes and dry shampoo, since she couldn't leave Lincoln's hospital room â not even to shower.Then, nearly a month after Lincoln got sick, he got better, she said. The support he required decreased enough that Zimmermann could administer the oxygen he required at home for the remainder of the time his body needed to heal.\"He's doing great,\" Zimmermann told CBS News on Friday. \"He's totally recovered. He's running around the backyard with his sisters, off of his oxygen, back to his normal 4-year-old self.\"Now, she said she hopes her son's story will serve as both a cautionary tale and a comfort to other families facing the prospect of a coronavirus-positive child.\"You see news stories: People are angry about being at home. Moms are angry about having to homeschool their kids,\" Zimmermann said. \"We're frustrated to have to stay home. And so I was wanting to write our story to say look, this is why you're doing it. Yeah, it's hard to be at home with your kids 24/7. And yes, it's hard to hold down a job. And yes, we're going to lose some income. But look how sick my son got. And we did everything right. And then followed right after that is: Look how sick my son got and he still recovered.\"", "section": "U.S.", "bylines": ["christina capatides"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "The Colorado mother said her son turned to her and said, \"Mama, it is no use.

Such a practice could be lethal or cause serious bodily harm.\"The confusion over disinfectants arose after health officials at the White House briefing Thursday evening presented \"emerging results\" of research on the benefits of sunlight and humidity and certain disinfectants in diminishing the threat of the virus on surfaces and in the air. President Trump then launched into speculation about the the possibility of injecting disinfectants as a treatment.During the televised briefing, Mr. Trump said he's seen \"the disinfectant where it knocks it [coronavirus] out in a minute.\" He continued, \"And is there a way you can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning? As you see, it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs â so it'll be interesting to check that. ... It sounds interesting to me.\"William Bryan, the head of the science and technology office at the Department of Homeland Security, appeared to quickly shoot down the idea. Asked by a reporter, \"There's no scenario that could be injected into a person, is there?\" Bryan replied, \"No.\"On \"CBS This Morning,\" chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook explained, \"Just because something works outside of the body doesn't mean you should bring it inside the body, where it could potentially cause severe damage.\" He added, \"The last thing you want is somebody hearing this, hearing this kind of a statement, and then â being very ill themselves, and saying, 'You know what, I'm gonna just give it a try.'\"After hearing the president's remark, many medical experts and elected officials spoke out on social media to publicly correct the dangerous idea about disinfectants. \"As a doctor, I recommend you do NOT inject disinfectant, and do NOT take medical advice from this person,\" Dr. Jason Westin, a cancer researcher in Houston, tweeted, sharing a clip from the briefing.\"With President Trump's press conference last night, it looks like we have a quack medicine salesman on TV,\" Senator Chuck Schumer tweeted. \"Injecting disinfectant? No. He must focus on testing, testing, testing.\"\"Good morning. Do not inject yourself with disinfectant,\" Michigan State Representative Laurie Pohutsky told her followers.The White House responded to the controversy with a statement Friday morning, saying: \"President Trump has repeatedly said that Americans should consult with medical doctors regarding coronavirus treatment, a point that he emphasized again during yesterday's briefing.  Leave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines.\"When the president was asked about his remark again Friday afternoon, he said, \"I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen.\" The EPA has compiled a list of disinfectants for use against COVID-19 â as household cleaners, not treatments. Several Lysol products and many other disinfectants are on the list. \"When using an EPA-registered disinfectant, follow the label directions for safe, effective use,\" the EPA states. The EPA also released a statement about disinfectants Thursday that included this advice: \"Never apply the product to yourself or others.

He's using the telescope now to help resolve discrepancies in that  expansion rate, high-stakes research that could reshape the theoretical underpinnings of cosmology.\"Obviously  there will be other telescopes, but I don't know if there's going to be  a telescope that takes us as far from sort of where we were to where we  end up,\" Riess said in an interview.\"It's almost like when  (sailors first) circumnavigated the globe, there's only sort of one time  that you get to open up that much unexplored territory. Hubble arrived  at a time when we had never seen the universe with that kind of crisp  resolution and able to see so far out. The new telescopes will really  help follow up on so much of what we learned from Hubble. It's just that  Hubble was such a game changer.\"James Fanson, project manager of  the Giant Magellan Telescope, one of the huge new ground-based  observatories now under development, said in a statement that Hubble had  revolutionized astronomy \"in the same way Galileo's telescope did 400  years ago when first turned to the heavens.\"\"Hubble's images  reached the level of art, and its discoveries touched the imagination of  ordinary people around the world. Hubble became the 'people's  telescope,' and it will always have a cherished place in our history and  culture.\"NASA unveiled a 30th anniversary photo from Hubble on Friday as part of a relatively subdued celebration. Because of coronavirus travel restrictions, a variety of events marking the anniversary have been put on hold.\"We'll   unveil the image for our staff just as it's being unveiled for   everybody else around the world,\" said Ken Sembach, director of the   Space Telescope Science Institute. \"And it is spectacular. We're going   to be doing that virtually, though. We had all kinds of events planned   around the world and with COVID, it's just going to be different.\"Many  of Hubble's most spectacular discoveries were unimagined when the  telescope was launched on April 24, 1990, especially after engineers  discovered its supposedly near-perfect 94.5-inch primary mirror was  perfectly flawed, a victim of spherical aberration that prevented the  telescope from bringing starlight to a sharp focus.Seven years behind schedule and some 400 percent over budget, Hubble had been launched to great fanfare and promises from NASA that it would take astronomy to new heights. Spherical aberration was an utterly gut-wrenching, almost impossible-to-believe defect, caused by an oversight during the mirror's fabrication.The dismal news was announced on June 27, 1990, and Hubble quickly became the butt of jokes on late-night television and the subject of heated congressional hearings, including one two days later in which Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski, a long-time NASA supporter whose district included the Goddard Space Flight Center, famously referred to Hubble as a \"techno turkey.\"\"What does this mean for the rest of the things you want to do?\" she was quoted by UPI. \"Are we going to keep ending up with techno turkeys? I think this has seriously hurt the credibility of NASA when they've had so much time and enough money to get it right.\"Said now-retired Hubble project scientist Ed Weiler, recalling the sense of despair that many felt: \"We went from the top of Mount Everest to the bottom of Death Valley.\"\"You know, people would stop me, pushing my little girl around the block, saying 'I'm so so sorry you have to work on that national disgrace',\" he said. \"It's great when your neighbors tell you that, right?\"But engineers quickly figured out a way to correct Hubble's blurry vision: installing a new camera, one that Weiler had recommended earlier, with relay mirrors ground to prescriptions that would exactly counteract the primary mirror's aberration.Building on that idea, another device, known as COSTAR, was designed to direct corrected light into Hubble's other instruments.During a make-or-break December 1993 shuttle servicing mission, the new Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 and COSTAR were installed by spacewalking astronauts. They also replaced Hubble's solar panels and other critical components.The following January, NASA unveiled the results during a news conference at Goddard: crystal-clear views of a galaxy known as M-100 that left no doubt Hubble was finally ready for prime time. Before the briefing began, Weiler showed Mikulski the pictures.\"I had them all laid out,\" he said. \"I had a picture of M-100 taken with spherical aberration, taken from the ground and then taken from Hubble, all three together. And she walked in. She looked at them and she said, 'My God, it's like putting on my glasses.' I'll never forget that moment.\"NASA would go on to launch four more servicing missions, installing new, state-of-the-art instruments and replacing aging components like critical fine guidance sensors and gyroscopes, which move the telescope from target to target and then lock-on with rock-solid stability for detailed observations.Eleven years after NASA's fifth and final servicing mission in May 2009, Hubble is still going strong. The Space Telescope Science Institute still receives some 1,200 observing proposals each year, of which only about 250 can be accommodated.\"Hubble's doing extremely well,\" Sembach said. \"It's still operating at peak performance. That means that it's continuing to have a full schedule of observations. In fact, the observatory's probably as efficient right now in conducting science as it's ever been. All the instruments are working really well.\"He said Hubble's subsystems also are behaving \"reasonably well.\"\"So good power, good pointing, good communications, good storage,\" he said. \"The gyros are operating better than we had expected. There are some little issues here and there, but we're dealing with those with flight software changes and so forth. So right now it's actually looking really good.\"The gyros are critical to Hubble's longevity. The telescope was launched with six ultra-stable gyroscopes, but only three at a time are needed for normal operation. During the final servicing mission, all six were replaced but since then, three have failed, leaving Hubble without any redundancy.\"The main issue that we're seeing in one of them ... is the bias rate,\" Sembach said. \"Every gyro has a little drift over time, it drifts a little bit from the position it thinks it's pointing to the position it senses. And so that's something that we correct all the time.\"In one case, one of the gyros, that bias level is getting up to levels where it's getting a little bit more flaky at times, which means we occasionally lose a guide star acquisition, or the pointing isn't quite as good as we would have liked. That's still a small number of cases. And the bias levels that we see are still within the range of being correct.\"To be on the safe side, engineers have developed software that would allow Hubble to operate with just two gyros or even one. The downside is the telescope could only reach targets in about half the sky at any given time instead of 85% or more with all three gyros.\"The thought would be, at least at the moment, that if one of those three gyros fails, we would, in fact, drop to one gyro control and turn the other one off to preserve its lifetime if we thought that that was the right thing to do at the time.\"Based on Hubble's current health, he added, \"we should have another good five years in it. And maybe longer. I would, for one, never bet against Hubble.\"Neither would Riess.\"You should never count out Hubble, that's what I've learned,\" Riess said. \"We're pretty optimistic we can get five more years. But as I said, I wouldn't count it out. If we come back in, you know, 10 years or 15 years and we found a way to keep it going in some useful way, that wouldn't shock me either.\"", "section": "Space", "bylines": ["William Harwood"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "Coronavirus disrupted plans to mark the Hubble Space Telescope's 30th anniversary, but its extraordinary work continues.", "originalurl": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hubble-space-telescope-30-years/", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.14278658433070196, "subjectivity": 0.5237459946099652, "wordcount": 1422}

The decision came more than six weeks after the Demon Deacons lost to Pittsburgh in the opening game of the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament, capping a third straight losing season. Manning, a former No. 1 overall NBA draft pick, went 78-111 in Winston-Salem with a 30-80 mark in ACC regular-season games. Those league struggles included a 6-49 mark in league road games and 1-6 in the ACC Tournament. Athletic director John Currie said in a statement the change came after\"a \"comprehensive review\" of the program. Currie said associate head coach and program great Randolph Childress will lead the program in the interim. Manning had said after the Pitt loss on March 10 that he \"absolutely\" expected to return next season, as well as in subsequent interviews amid the coronavirus pandemic that had led to a shutdown of college and professional sports.   \"I wish the program nothing but success going forward,\" Manning said in a school statement Saturday. The Demon Deacons appeared to be trending upward in 2017, when sophomore John Collins led the Demon Deacons to a 19-win season and a .500 league mark along with a spot in the NCAA's First Four. But Collins left to become a first-round NBA draft pick, while junior Dino Mitoglou left to play professionally in Europe. And over the next few seasons, key players such as Bryant Crawford, Doral Moore and Keyshawn Woods left with eligibility remaining to pursue professional careers or play elsewhere in college. It happened again in the past two weeks, with junior Chaundee Brown announcing he would enter his name into the NBA draft as well as the NCAA transfer portal. Amid that turnover, Manning's program never was able to build on the 2017 run, going 11-20 in each of the following two seasons. Along the way, once-rowdy gameday environments at Joel Coliseum during the Chris Paul and Skip Prosser eras a decade earlier grew quiet amid large swaths of empty seats. And games against in-state ACC foes Duke, North Carolina and N.C. State often drew significant numbers of fans wearing the blues or red of the visitors. Retiring athletic director Ron Wellman announced last March that Manning would return despite a third 20-loss season in five years, saying that he expected Manning would \"take the steps needed to show improvement on the court\" as the school transitioned to Currie as Wellman's successor. There were positive moments in 2020, namely Manning's first wins against Duke (in a double-overtime comeback victory) and UNC in February. But overall, Wake Forest won just 13 games, two more than a year earlier. Manning was the top NBA draft pick in 1988 after leading Kansas almost single-handedly to a national championship so unexpected the group was nicknamed \"Danny and the Miracles.\"  He played 15 seasons in the NBA before getting into coaching, first on Bill Self's staff at Kansas and then spending two seasons as head coach at Tulsa before taking over at Wake Forest in 2014.

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and since the Permian Basin is so large, this excess waste is a significant contribution to our already warming climate.\"These are the highest emissions ever measured from a major U.S. oil and gas basin,\" said study co-author Dr. Steven Hamburg, chief scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). To map the methane emissions, the team employed a space-borne sensor on a European Space Agency satellite called the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) from May 2018 to March 2019. Since 2005, the rapid increase in oil and natural gas production in the United States has been driven primarily by hydraulic fracturing (also known as fracking) and horizontal drilling. While some see the leaked methane gas as a big waste of natural resources, others are focused on the danger posed by methane. Methane is an extremely powerful heat-trapping greenhouse gas, much more potent than its more well-known counterpart, carbon dioxide (CO2).There is 225 times less methane in the atmosphere than there is CO2, but because of its powerful heat-trapping qualities, methane is contributing about 25% of the current rate of global warming.Since the Industrial Revolution, global methane concentrations have doubled due mostly to human activities like livestock farming, decay from landfills, and from burning fossil fuels. \"I am very concerned about increasing methane emissions,\" said Dr. Robert Howarth, a biogeochemist and expert on methane from Cornell University, who was not involved with the study. \"Methane is 120 times more powerful than CO2 as a greenhouse gas, compared mass-to-mass for the time both gases are in the atmosphere,\" he explains.According to Hamburg, the methane gas escaping the Permian Basin is so excessive that it has tripled the typical heating impact it would have otherwise had through burning the gas. Evidence of this massive leakage undercuts the case made by proponents of natural gas who tout its cleaner-burning qualities over that of its normally dirtier-burning cousin, coal.\"The most up-to-date thinking is that for comparing coal and natural gas to generate electricity, gas is worse than coal if the methane emission rate is greater than 2.7%,\" said Howarth. However, this research found the Permian Basin's emission rate is higher than that â 3.7% of the gross gas extracted. Therefore, the leakage in the Permian Basin is so high it makes gas and oil emissions more intensive than even coal.\"After staying level for the first decade of the 21st century, methane emissions have been rising quickly over the past decade,\" said Howarth, \"My research indicates that shale gas development in the U.S. is responsible for at least one-third of the total increase in these emissions globally.\"The Harvard/EDF paper attributes the high methane leakage rate to extensive venting and flaring, resulting from insufficient infrastructure to process and transport natural gas.On the other hand, the paper concludes, the higher-than-average leakage rate in the Permian Basin implies an opportunity to reduce methane emissions through better design, more effective management, regulation and infrastructure development.But over the past few years, regulations on fossil fuels have gone in the opposite direction. \"Trump's EPA has proposed to substantially weaken or even eliminate regulations, adopted during the Obama administration, to control methane emissions from oil and gas facilities,\" said Romany Webb, a senior fellow at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School.Webb says the Texas Railroad Commission â the state's oil and gas regulator â has its own rules controlling venting and flaring. Venting and flaring is permitted up to 10 days after completion of well drilling; after that operators can apply for an exemption from the commission. \"Recently, the number of exemptions granted by the commission has increased dramatically, leading to concerns that it is simply acting as a rubber stamp,\" said Webb.\"To detect emissions takes sophisticated approaches and highly trained personnel,\" Howarth said. \"To date, the best any government has done is to come up with regulations that rely on industry self-reporting. I find that rather useless.\" If the world has any hope of meeting the target for reducing emissions outlined in the Paris climate agreement, reducing CO2 cannot accomplish this alone â the climate responds far more quickly to methane, explains Howarth. To keep the level of warming below the international goal of 2 degrees Celsius and prevent the most catastrophic impacts of climate change, controlling methane leakage is essential. Without it, humanity is bound to fall short. ", "section": "U.S.", "bylines": ["Jeff Berardelli"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "A new study says enough methane is spewing out of the Permian Basin to power 7 million households in Texas for a year.", "originalurl": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/methane-permian-basin-oil-gas-climate-change/", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.12342902016682505, "subjectivity": 0.42052027241051615, "wordcount": 866}

McCarthy said in a statement Saturday night that he made the decision to hold the graduation \"after careful consideration of the steps the Army can take to mitigate risk.\" McCarthy said that West Point will communicate the plan for graduation \"over the next couple of days.\"The academy is located about an hour from New York City, the epicenter of the United State's coronavirus outbreak. As the virus took hold in New York state, the school decided to delay the cadets' return, and they have been attending classes virtually ever since. During a White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing last week, Mr. Trump announced he would be delivering the academy's commencement address this year.\"I think, making the commencement speech â I'm doing it at West Point, which I look forward to. I did it last year at Air Force, I did it at Annapolis, I did it at the Coast Guard Academy, and I'm doing it at West Point,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And I assume they're â they've got it, and I understand they'll have distancing. They'll have some big distance, and so it'll be very different than it ever looked.\"\"Do I like the look? No, I don't.

And that's going to happen again,\" he said. Five days later, on April 22, West Point issued a press release announcing that the president would serve as its commencement speaker. It will be Mr. Trump's first time delivering the school's address, after Vice President Mike Pence did last year. \"We are honored to host the Commander-in-Chief as we celebrate the many accomplishments of our graduating class,\" said Lt.

Over the years and throughout different administrations, Gee has found that the government has violated elements of the settlement, primarily its requirement that migrant children be released from custody without \"unnecessary delay.\" But Friday's order considered the risks faced by immigrants detained in close quarters during a deadly, global pandemic. In a different order last month, Gee called immigration detention centers \"hotbeds of contagion.\" The order applies to the approximately 2,100 unaccompanied minors in ORR custody, as well as the 342 children held with their families at the three ICE family detention centers.  Through Friday's order, Gee required both ICE and the U.S. refugee agency to \"make every effort to promptly and safely\" release the children in their custody who have sponsors, don't pose a danger to themselves or others and are not flight risks. She prohibited the agencies from using certain justifications to continue detaining minors.  Read more here.                                                                              By Camilo Montoya-Galvez                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-42a9f3a3                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       10:08 PM / April 24, 2020              Doctor details \"torture\" of watching her 4-year-old son struggling to breathe while battling coronavirus                                                            As the coronavirus pandemic spreads throughout the world, countless gut-wrenching stories have emerged of families battling the virus. Some of the most difficult to hear are those which involve children. And Dr. Anna Zimmermann, a neonatologist in Denver, Colorado, just added her son's story to that list. \"Since March 12th, the kids have not left the house,\" she wrote in a blog post on her website, Mighty Littles. \"My husband went to Costco once. I went to Target once. My kids never went on a playdate. I wouldn't let them go across the street to talk to their neighborhood friends. We adopted the stay-at-home recommendations early and stuck to them. We did everything right. But Lincoln got sick.\" Zimmerman said her son, Lincoln, is four years old. He didn't know what coronavirus was when he was admitted to Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children, where his mother works in the NICU. \"At the time of admission, he needed 2 Liters (L) of oxygen. That same night, he progressed up to needing 4L. By the next day, he was on 6L and then 9L,\" Zimmermann wrote. \"He was working so hard to breathe - using all of the muscles in his chest, abdomen, and neck to help him breathe. As a doctor, I knew he was working hard to breathe. The medical terms used to describe respiratory distress - seesaw breathing, nasal flaring, grunting, retracting, tachypneic - he had them all. As a mom, it was torture watching him struggle.\" Read more here.                                                                              By christina capatides                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-aedea40d                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       8:57 PM / April 24, 2020              Small Business Administration disaster loan program is a disaster, business owners say                                                            The federal government's disaster loan fund for small employers has drawn far less scrutiny than the infamously deficient  Paycheck Protection Program , but it may be just as dysfunctional. The Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program, recently expanded to cover businesses affected by the  coronavirus , offers qualified firms emergency cash advances of up to $10,000 on low-interest loans worth up to $2 million that are repayable over 30 years.  It sounds promising, but small business owners who have applied for the loans through the U.S. Small Business Administration describe the process as confusing and complain that the money is slow to materialize.   \"We put in our EIDL application right away. First we were told it was for $10,000. About a month later, on April 23, we found money in our account, but it wasn't anything close to what we thought we were getting,\" said K.B. Brown, owner of Wolfpack Promotionals, a print shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Weeks after he applied, Brown said he received a $3,000 advance on the loan, which isn't enough to cover even one month of business expenses. He doesn't know if he'll be approved for a larger disaster loan, noting that he hasn't received any follow-up information from the SBA.  \"Right now, we need at least $25,000 on the low end to get caught up, make sure our vendors are paid, and bring people back,\" Brown said.  Read more here.                                                                              By Megan Cerullo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-205a6052                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       8:09 PM / April 24, 2020              Brazil becoming virus hotspot as hospitals buckle                                                            Cases of the new coronavirus are overwhelming hospitals, morgues and cemeteries across Brazil as Latin America's largest nation veers closer to becoming one of the world's pandemic hot spots. Medical officials in Rio de Janeiro and at least four other major cities have warned that their hospital systems are on the verge of collapse, or already too overwhelmed to take any more patients. Health experts expect the number of infections in the country of 211 million people will be much higher than what has been reported because of insufficient, delayed testing. Meanwhile, President Jair Bolsonaro has shown no sign of wavering from his insistence that COVID-19 is a relatively minor disease and that broad social-distancing measures are not needed to stop it. He has said only Brazilians at high risk should be isolated. In Manaus, the biggest city in the Amazon, officials said a cemetery has been forced to dig mass graves because there have been so many deaths. Workers have been burying 100 corpses a day - triple the previous average of burials.

The total number of patients in hospitals has also dropped to nearly 25% less than the peak. But Governor Andrew Cuomo is warning that there's still a long road ahead.  \"Number of new people coming into the hospital, number of new infections is slightly down, but that's basically a flat line,\" Cuomo said Friday. \"And that is troubling.\"  Preliminary results from antibody tests in the state found that nearly 14%, or roughly 2.7 million people, showed evidence of past infection.  \"If it turns out that it's higher than we even think, that's good and that's bad,\" said CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook. \"On the one hand, it's bad because that means that a lot of people have been infected and probably spreading it asymptomatically. And that's hard to get your arms around. On the other hand, it's good because if it's asymptomatic and people recover without us knowing it, then no harm, no foul.\"                                                             By Mola Lenghi                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-ff82840d                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       6:48 PM / April 24, 2020              French hotel executive says rough year ahead                                                            A French hotel executive predicts his business will remain \"catastrophic\" for the rest of this year and is counting on government help to survive the virus crisis. Serge Cachan, president of the Astotel chain of Paris hotels, told The Associated Press: \"Zero percent in April, probably in May and probably in June.\" He forecasts losses this year of 60-70%. \"Why should a hotel be open when you have no clients? When you have no restaurants. No museums. When you have no theaters, and when you have no planes, and when you close the borders. Why should the people come?\" he asked. Earlier Friday, French authorities said France won't reopen its restaurants, bars and cafes before June, as they announced reinforced financial support for the sector amid the virus crisis. Other tourist sites like museums will also remain closed.

She asked if it was true that the FDA has no review of the antibody tests on the market, and there is no way to check their accuracy.  Hahn said under the policy, manufacturers have to validate their tests, tell the FDA the tests have been validated and let people know that those tests were not authorized by the FDA.  Additionally, Hahn said the FDA has authorized four tests and there are \"more in the pipeline.\" Hahn said they are working to approve the tests that have been \"self-validated.\"                                                                             By Caroline Linton                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-f50ab48b                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       6:35 PM / April 24, 2020              Trump says \"it's exciting to see\" the country reopening                                                            President Trump said Friday at the White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing that there is evidence the \"aggressive strategy\" the government took is working. Mr. Trump said half of Americans live in states that are opening up their economy. \"We're opening our country,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's very exciting to see. We have a lot of talent involved. From governors to people who just stand there and help you with the doors. Our country is in a great place and it's going to be greater than ever before.\"  Mr. Trump claimed 18 states have started to see decreases in the number of positive tests, and that New York has seen a 50% decrease in a week. On Friday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the number of new infections in the state is \"slightly down, but that's basically a flat line.\" Since April 18, the number of single-day deaths due to the coronavirus in New York have remained below 500. On Thursday, 422 died from the virus.

Georgia on Friday let employers including hair salons and restaurants begin admitting customers, while Alaska, Oklahoma and Texas are discussing reopening strategies. Many other states' stay-at-home orders expire at the end of April. Yet those states and the vast majority of others do not yet meet the criteria to start loosening coronavirus-related restrictions safely, according to research by health care analysts at investment banking company Raymond James. Just four of 50 states meet all of the White House's criteria to begin a phased reopening, Raymond James wrote. Those are Kansas, Montana, Washington and Wyoming. The findings are based on the guidance suggested in the White House's reopening plan, which are called \"gating criteria.\" That plan recommends (but does not require) that states hold off on reopening non-essential businesses until they see a 14-day decline in flu-like illnesses and positive COVID-19 tests; hospitals can treat all patients; and there is a \"robust testing program\" that includes antibody testing that can confirm whether someone has been exposed to the coronavirus.

He is required to wear an ankle security bracelet, and is escorted on the flight, the lawyer added.  Avenatti's release came after his attorney argued in court papers that he was at risk of contracting COVID-19 in the facility because he had pneumonia six months ago. He is required to return to New York in 90 days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-6273da03                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       5:28 PM / April 24, 2020              Belgium taking steps to relax its virus lockdown                                                            Belgium is taking its first serious steps to relax its coronavirus lockdown. After May 3, hospitals will progressively open to some non-essential tasks and textile shops also will be allowed to reopen. One week later, most shops will be given the green light to reopen at the same time, though close-contact professions like barbers will have to wait another week. Also, as of May 18, the government will allow internal travel to the coast and the hilly, wooded Ardennes forests. Bar and restaurants will be allowed to start reopening as of June 8, as will be zoos. Travel authorizations will also be expanded. Protective masks will be mandatory on public transportation.

Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Mark Esper had suggested it was possible Crozier's command of the carrier might be restored once an investigation into his firing was complete. Crozier was removed from his command after a memo he circulated pleading for help from Washington became public. As of Friday, 856 members of the 4,000-person crew on the USS Roosevelt, a Navy aircraft carrier docked in Guam, have tested positive for the coronavirus. The Navy said 112 sailors have recovered and more than 4,200 have moved ashore.

Premier Giuseppe Conte's Cabinet has decided on a revised budget for this year, one that calls for $60 billion in debt, $27.5 billion next year, and similarly high debt for several more years. The budget must be approved by parliament. The government says it must beef up the national health system, whose intensive care units were sorely tested by huge numbers of coronavirus patients, as well as provide additional funds for law enforcement and civil protection agencies to deal with the emergency. More funds will also be earmarked for private and public economic sectors and to provide safety measures for workers heading back to work after national lockdown, now in its seventh week.

Doctors say absolutely not.                                                            CNN anchor Chris Cuomo's wife, Cristina Greeven Cuomo, announced on her blog that she bathed in a bleach solution while battling the coronavirus. Doctors say that's a very bad idea.  Cuomo said she decided to give the bath a try as a \"more affordable\" alternative to an IV vitamin drip to purportedly \"neutralize heavy metals\" in the body. She added that Dr. Linda Lancaster suggested a bath with \"a nominal amount of bleach,\" and explained that the idea is to \"combat the radiation and metals in my system and oxygenate it.\"  Cuomo said since she had no sense of smell or open cuts, she decided to try it. \"So, I add a small amount—1/4 to 1/2 cup ONLY—of Clorox to a full bath of warm water (80 gallons),\" she wrote. However, many doctors advise against trying this — and warn in stark terms that it could be dangerous. In an email to CBS News, microbiologist Dr. Dean Hart said bathing in bleach is a \"bad idea.\"   \"While us in science do not like to speak in absolutism, I have never heard, ever, of a bleach bath being recommended for the treatment of any disease,\" Hart said. \"Don't do that. It is not a good idea, in fact, it's a bad idea. It could hurt you. The air becomes toxic around a bleach or chlorine bath. This has the potential to be very harmful, whether you are observing through your skin or breathing.\" Read more here.                                                                              By Caitlin O'Kane                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-78ea5b52                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       4:20 PM / April 24, 2020              Puerto Rico to test nearly 9,000 inmates                                                            Puerto Rico's Department of Corrections says it will test all the nearly 9,000 inmates being held across the U.S. territory to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Officials say 6,000 employees, including prison guards who work at the island's 32 correctional facilities, also will be tested. Corrections Secretary Eduardo Rivera says officials have been testing new inmates since April 8. The announcement comes after a handful of inmates in recent days tested positive even though they were asymptomatic. Puerto Rico has reported at least 77 deaths and more than 1,270 confirmed cases of COVID-19.

The warning comes just days after a study suggested the drug had no benefit for coronavirus patients and was even associated with more deaths. The FDA said there were reports that some patients treated with hydroxychloroquine showed \"serious heart rhythm problems.\" Patients with other health issues, such as heart or kidney disease, showed an increased risk of heart problems when they were treated with the drug. \"Therefore, we would like to remind health care professionals and patients of the known risks associated with both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine,\" the agency wrote on its website, referring also to a similar drug. \"Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing COVID-19.\" The agency said hydroxychloroquine should only be used in clinical trials or under careful medical supervision in hospital patients under an emergency use authorization. The FDA will continue to study the drug.

Leslie Lewis, sentenced to 24 months for a white-collar offense. is a first-time offender currently serving her time at Alderson FPC, a Women's Camp in West Virginia. She learned that she had been selected for release to home confinement and filled out her paperwork on April 15 and called her husband of 21 years, John, to share the good news. But by Monday their dream had been taken away from them. \"On Monday first thing in the morning, Leslie calls me, bawling. I know my wife enough to know she was shaking,\" John told CBS News in an interview. \"She said they told her that she had been denied because of the 50% rule now, and they didn't give an explanation.\"  The original instruction came on March 26, when Attorney General William Barr directed the Bureau of Prisons to prioritize the use of home confinement for at-risk inmates as a means of curbing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Read more here.                                                                              By Clare Hymes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-2f65c007                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       Updated 4:00 PM / April 24, 2020              Coronavirus is spreading fast in states that may reopen soon, study finds                                                            The COVID-19 coronavirus has saturated the United States, and it appears to be spreading quickly in some places that are planning to ease social distancing restrictions soon, a new study shows.

The number of cases in every region today are higher than they were a week ago,\" said Fisher. \"We have no place in the country where there are not cases being reported within a region.\" The data also show that COVID-19 cases are growing more rapidly in places that have not been as heavily hit as New York City, Seattle, San Francisco and other early coronavirus hot spots. \"The growth rates that are highest are now in the Midwest and in the South,\" Fisher said.

The Tri-County Health Department reports six confirmed cases of COVID-19 among employees, plus an additional three tests that are being processed. \"We are extremely saddened by this news and offer our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of the three people we lost,\" said John Douglas, the department's executive director. \"These deaths underscore the severity of the highly-contagious coronavirus, and the need for diligent safety precautions to prevent any further spread, including the wearing of masks. A spokesperson for Walmart confirmed the store was closed for cleaning on Thursday. Health officials said the store will be able to reopen once the store demonstrates that all safety standards are met, including social distancing marks on the floor and masks for employees.

We have asked for lesser movements with the inmates and they have listened to us,\" said Michael Tirado, with PBA Local 105, said. Some changes have been made to New Jersey jails and prisons to lessen the risk of staff or inmates from contracting the coronavirus. But even with the changes, Tirado said the Department of Corrections lost at least two officers to the irus. \"Officer Nelson Perdomo from East Jersey State Prison and just recently yesterday, we lost Officer Maria Gibbs,\" Tirado said.

Health authorities say France doubled its number of intensive care beds to more than 10,000 as the virus raced across the country. \"We need to keep the beds in case of a return of the epidemic,\" national health agency director Jerome Salomon says. \"We need to maintain a vigilant posture.\" Now fewer than 5,000 people are in intensive care with the virus, but people with other severe illnesses also need the beds. France has reported more virus deaths than any country but the U.S., Italy and Spain. Salomon has announced more than 22,000 virus deaths so far in French hospitals and nursing homes.

California Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday signed an executive order suspending the ban for 60 days. Grocery stores are now able to give out single-use plastic or paper bags to customers for free. The order also allows stores to stop accepting recycled bottles and cans.

In Miami, Florida, there were no homicides for seven weeks for the first time since 1957, according to the Miami Police Department. There were also no homicides during a six-week period for the first time since 1960. \"We can say that it's due to our police high visibility, attributed with the pandemic and the Stay At Home order,\" a Miami Police Department spokesperson told CBS News.   Miami Mayor Francis Suarez declared a local state of emergency on March 12 to slow the spread of the coronavirus, and the order has since been extended six times in week-long increments.

The contact tracing technology, which the two companies have been working on for a little over a month, was initially designed to help people alert one another if someone they were in contact with over a 14-day period was diagnosed with the virus. When the project was first announced, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google head Sundar Pichai promised the technology would be built with privacy in mind. Apple and Google said the technology will be opt-in, meaning it won't be turned on by default. The companies will offer programming tools to developers in mid-May, allowing health authorities to build apps with this new technology. Then Apple and Google plan to offer software updates to more than 2 billion active devices around the world using their software by the end of the year.  To ensure further security, Apple and Google said they'd change the contact tracing program to use better encryption, scrambling any identifying information to ensure people cannot be tracked. The companies are also protecting any potentially identifiable information about a person's phone, such as which model of phone they're using or the signal strength of their transmissions.  Read more at CNET.

(On Friday, Mr. Trump  claimed  he was being sarcastic). Dr. Bob Lahita, chairman of medicine at St. Joseph University Hospital, called the president's public suggestions a \"mistake\" in an interview on CBSN. \"There is no disinfectant-like treatment that is injected into the body. Categorically, absolutely, positively, no,\" he told CBSN anchors Vladimir Duthiers and Anne-Marie Green. \"And as far as UV light goes, there are no treatments except perhaps for psoriasis, done under the guidance of a dermatologist.\"  Lahita denied that disinfectant was in any way OK for internal use, pointing out that \"it's a very deadly thing\" and said drinking bleach was something found in suicide attempts.

On Thursday, 422 died from the virus.  \"This is at an unimaginable level,\" Cuomo said of the lives lost. \"It's dropping somewhat, but it's still devastating news.\"                                                                             By Audrey McNamara                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-a9288b6d                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       1:34 PM / April 24, 2020              Trump says he was being sarcastic when he floated disinfectant as virus treatment                                                            President Trump claimed Friday that he was being sarcastic when he floated the possibility of  injecting COVID-19 patients with disinfectant . Hours earlier, the White House press secretary had given a different explanation for the remarks, saying they were taken out of context.   \"I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen,\" the president told CBS News' Weijia Jiang in the Oval Office.   During Thursday night's coronavirus task force briefing, the president suggested that health experts look into the possibility of using disinfectant for coronavirus patients, perhaps by injection. Since then, the U.S. surgeon general and Lysol have come out strongly discouraging people from trying to ingest the product.  Read more here.                                                                              By Kathryn Watson                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-26ab94f9                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       1:19 PM / April 24, 2020              Some businesses in Georgia start reopening                                                            Some businesses in Georgia reopened cautiously Friday as the Republican governor eased a monthlong shutdown amid experts' warnings of a potential new surge in coronavirus infections and a potent objection from President Trump. Georgia has ranked in the bottom per capita for testing and critics say Governor Brian Kemp's order was premature.  With deaths and infections still rising in the state, many business owners planned to remain closed in spite of Kemp's assurance that hospital visits and new cases have leveled off enough for barbers, tattoo artists, massage therapists and personal trainers to return to work with restrictions including screening of customers' for potential symptoms, protective gear and frequent cleaning.

In an alert Friday, regulators flagged reports of serious side effects and death  among patients taking hydroxychloroquine and the related drug chloroquine.  The drugs, also prescribed for lupus, can cause a number of side effects, including heart rhythm problems, severely low blood pressure and muscle or nerve damage.  Last month, the FDA authorized emergency use of the malaria drugs for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who aren't enrolled in ongoing clinical trials. But regulators said they are investigating life-threatening side effects reported with the drugs to poison control centers and other health authorities.  Calls to U.S. poison control centers involving the malaria drugs have recently jumped 50%, from 52 calls in March 2019 to 79 last month, according to Dr. Christopher Hoyte of the Rocky Mountain Poison Center in Denver, Colorado. The problems reported include irregular heart rhythms, seizures, nausea and vomiting, Hoyte said.                                                                              By Associated Press                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-536b5361                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       12:29 PM / April 24, 2020              13 U.S. meat industry workers have died of coronavirus, union says                                                            Ten meatpacking workers and three food processing workers have died of COVID-19, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW). In addition, at least 5,000 meatpacking workers and 1,500 food processing workers have been directly impacted by the virus, from testing positive for the disease it causes to missing work due to self-quarantine while they await test results, the labor group said.  The union, which represents 250,000 meatpacking and poultry plant workers, is calling for improved protections for those on the front lines of sustaining the nation's food supply. The union's tally of fatalities is lower than one compiled by the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting. The center  found  that as of Thursday there had been at least 3,400 reported positive cases tied to meatpacking facilities at 62 plants in 23 states and at least 17 reported worker deaths at eight plants in eight states.

He also suggested Republicans should oppose additional aid for state and local governments in future coronavirus relief bills.  Unlike cities and local governments, state governments cannot declare bankruptcy. But McConnell told radio host Hugh Hewitt Wednesday that he \"would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route.\"  \"It saves some cities. And there's no good reason for it not to be available,\" he said. \"My guess is their first choice would be for the federal government to borrow money from future generations to send it down to them now so they don't have to do that. That's not something I'm going to be in favor of.\"  Cuomo called the idea \"the most un-American, un-charitable statement of all time.\" The governor said Friday at his daily briefing that New York gives the most money of any state to the \"federal pot,\" while Kentucky takes the third most out of the pot. \"Just give me my money back, senator,\" Cuomo said.  \"I say pass a law allowing states to declare bankruptcy. I dare you,\" the governor said.  He warned that such a bill would signal \"turmoil\" to the markets, further jeopardizing the country's economy. \"We'll see how many states take you up on it,\" he said.

At least 17 sailors have since tested positive, and the Navy said it expects more cases.  The sailor who was evacuated is being treated in San Antonio, Texas. The Navy said the destroyer will be disinfected after returning to port.  The new cases follow a coronavirus outbreak among crewmembers of the USS Theodore Roosevelt.

This is something the state could do quickly and easily, and it makes so much sense. Those security deposits are stuck in escrow accounts. The tenant can't use them, the landlord can't use them until someone leaves their apartment for good,\" de Blasio said, reports CBS New York. \"It makes no sense given that we're dealing with an absolutely unprecedented crisis.\"  \"If people just run out of money, let them defer the rent. They can pay it back after a period of time. If people don't have any money, they don't have any money,\" he said.                                                                              By Sarah Lynch Baldwin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-5cd647e9                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       11:36 AM / April 24, 2020              Pandemic model estimates virus was spreading earlier than U.S. realized                                                            New information  suggests the  coronavirus  was spreading rapidly in the United States much earlier than first thought.

South African Emergency Medicine specialist Professor Feroza Motara heads up the team that developed the box for high risk procedures like intubation, which is required to put a patient on a mechanical ventilator.  \"The risk is that when you are trying to do that intubation you are literally over the patient, so all that stuff, even with a mask and gown, all that aerosolized material is then hitting you, whereas now, it's in the box,\" Motara told CBS News. Africa already had some success with a similar innovation treating Ebola patients —  a large plastic cube  that protects medical staff from that deadly virus. The Ebola CUBE was the inspiration for the South African design that was modified by aeronautical company Paramount to become the Intubox. It took just two weeks from conception for the box to be rolled out to South African hospitals, and it's already been used successfully on several South African COVID-19 patients. Now there's interest from a few U.S. companies. South Africa is bracing for an expected spike in COVID-19 patients, and while desperate times call for desperate measures, they also lead to great innovations.

The measure immediately replaces one that was scheduled to expire next week.  Michigan has nearly 3,000 deaths related to COVID-19, trailing only New York and New Jersey among U.S. states. Whitmer said in the new order the prior order had been \"effective,\" and that \"the strain on our health care system has begun to relent, even as our testing capacity has increased.\" Social distancing measures will remain in place. People are now required to wear face coverings in enclosed public spaces such as grocery stores if they can medically tolerate it. Employers must provide non-medical grade masks to their in-person employees.

The first country to issue nation-wide lockdown orders more than a month ago is now letting a limited number of shops get back to business. It has started with clothing stores for children and bookstores.  The International Monetary Fund expect's Italy's economy to contract by more than 9% by the end of the year — the worst projection in Europe.  The prime minister said this week that the country is on track to open even more businesses on May 4. The re-openings are thanks to the fact that, for the first time since this outbreak exploded, recoveries have started to outpace the number of new cases recorded daily.  But the timid loosening of the lockdown must be gradual and follow the science, the prime minister has said. Re-opening too soon could spark a second explosion of the virus in a country that has already suffered so much.

Professor Sarah Gilbert heads the Oxford team behind the potential vaccine being developed in partnership with the Jenner Institute. She's said it has an \"80% chance\" of success, and it could be available for wide use by the public as soon as September. Human trials of the vaccine began Thursday in Oxford. It will be administered to 510 healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55. U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said the government is \"throwing everything\" at efforts in the country to create a COVID-19 vaccine. He's pledged around $25 million in public funding for the Oxford project and an additional $27 million to research initiatives at Imperial College London. He says the U.K. is \"at the front of the global effort\" to find a vaccine.  Click here to read more .

According to a statement, ExxonMobil hopes to ship 160,000 gallons of sanitizer, equivalent to almost 5 million of the typical 4-ounce bottles, with its initial wave of production. Hand sanitizer, along with more vital personal protection equipment (PPE) supplies like face masks and medical gowns,  have been in short supply  in the U.S. for weeks amid the coronavirus crisis.

Some Americans were already looking for jobs before the coronavirus shut down much of the economy. Four Kansas aerospace workers who were laid off when Boeing suspended production of the 737 Max jet, weeks before the coronavirus crisis even hit, are still unemployed. Their severance has now run out and their health insurance will end next week. \"It's pretty bleak right now … It's a scary time to be without insurance,\" said Chris Jump, who was laid off as an aircraft mechanic. \"If we hadn't got the stimulus check, I don't think we would have paid rent this month.\" It's been a long frustrating search for Jump, who is a father of four.

Footage on social media showed two DJs playing dance music to the crew of the HMS Trenchant.   The crewmembers were sitting at tables eating a barbecue after the vessel docked for repairs at its base near Plymouth, southwest England, following three months at sea. The video shows sailors dancing and laughing, and a source told BBC News some were drinking alcohol. The gathering went against government social distancing rules introduced to try to slow the spread of coronavirus, which has left more than 18,000 people dead in Britain alone. - CBS/AP                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-8bd634d0                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       8:29 AM / April 24, 2020              Amid race to ramp-up COVID-19 testing, U.K. government's sign-up site crashes                                                            Britain's government website for essential workers to schedule COVID-19 tests was closed to new applicants Friday just hours after it opened.  \"There has been significant demand for booking tests today. We apologise for any inconvenience. We are continuing to rapidly increase availability,\" the Health Ministry said on Twitter, promising more tests would be available to book from Saturday. Up to 10 million essential workers and members of their households are eligible for testing under the U.K. government's COVID-19 response policy, including health and social workers, police, food production workers, transport officers and journalists.  The aim is to allow any essential workers who show symptoms or have family members with symptoms to return to work as quickly as possible.  Increasing testing capacity has been central to the British government's strategy for tackling the coronavirus. Leaders have set the target of testing 100,000 people every day by the end of April.  Some experts have been skeptical of the government's capacity to deliver on its commitment. On April 22, the last day for which data is publicly available, only 23,560 COVID-19 tests were carried out.                                                                              By Haley Ott                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-f7175f4d                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       8:07 AM / April 24, 2020              Nebraska governor says he'll keep meatpacking plants open as shortages would bring \"civil unrest\"                                                            Governor Pete Ricketts said Thursday that he doesn't plan to close any of Nebraska's meatpacking plants despite a surge in coronavirus cases in their surrounding communities that have turned them into the state's biggest COVID-19 hot spots. Ricketts said he was concerned that shuttering the plants could hurt the state's food supply and lead to \"civil unrest\" if residents were to suddenly lose access to meat. \"You want to talk about some of these protests going on right now?\" he said during a news conference. \"Think about how mad people were when they couldn't get paper products. Think about if they couldn't get food. This is why it's vitally important that we keep our food processors open and do everything we can to ensure the supply chain, because we would have civil unrest if that was not the case.\"                                                             By Associated Press                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-fcc1dae8                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       7:28 AM / April 24, 2020              WHO warns malaria deaths in sub-Saharan Africa could double this year as COVID-19 diverts focus                                                            One of the hard lessons the World Health Organization learned during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa was this: Other diseases can be forgotten and take a deadlier toll.  The WHO is now warning that the battle against malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, where it already kills hundreds of thousands of people a year, could be set back by 20 years as countries focus energy and resources on containing the coronavirus.   The WHO said new projections indicate that in a worst-case scenario, 769,000 people could die of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa this year as campaigns to combat it are interrupted. That's more than double the deaths in the last detailed count two years ago, when more than 360,000 people died, and would be the worst figures for the region since 2000.   \"We must not turn back the clock,\" Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said Thursday.                                                              By Associated Press                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-d265ed64                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       6:52 AM / April 24, 2020              Joe Biden says he expects President Trump to try to postpone the election                                                            Joe Biden predicted President Trump will try to push back November's general election in an effort to help him win. \"Mark my words, I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held,\" Biden said during a Thursday evening virtual fundraiser. The presumptive Democratic nominee latched on to Mr. Trump's earlier resistance to grant COVID-19 federal relief money to the postal service, labeling the move \"un-American.\" On April 10, the  postmaster general requested help , saying the service was at a \" critical juncture \" and faced a net operating loss of more than $22 billion over the next 18 months. Not financially assisting the postal service, Biden alleged, would be one way the Trump administration could impact proposed expansion of vote-by-mail efforts for the general election.

Washburne, a Trump donor and member of the president's Intelligence Advisory Board, spoke to CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett for this week's episode of \"The Takeout\" podcast. Washburne said opening up restaurants so they can serve customers at half-capacity wouldn't be feasible, and keeping restaurant workers and customers at a safe distance would be difficult to enforce. \"The economics just don't work. My belief is we're either all in or we're not, because half of one restaurant is just a money loser,\" Washburne said. \"It just, practically, doesn't work.\"  Click here to read more .

He suggested the best way to reduce shopping time was to delegate it to the man of the family. \"Men are faster. They just buy what they're told,\" he asserted. \"Men go straight to where the product is shelved, put it in the basket. It saves time.\" \"I don't think this is an issue of gender,\" a male reporter gently pushed back. \"It sounds odd when you say, 'women take more time to shop.'\" The 56-year-old conservative was unshakeable. \"Well, in my house, my wife takes longer, and I'm faster.\" The reaction was swift and generally unsympathetic. \"People who have no clue what daily life is about, we don't need their advice,\" said one tweet. \"My husband ends up choosing the more expensive brand,\" said one woman. \"Old dudes hanging around the store, don't they just get in the way? Better for them to stay home and watch the kids.\" Recent government statistics show that while Japanese politics remains stuck in the Mad Men era, its society has drastically shifted. The most recent government white paper on gender equity found 11.88 million double-income households, and only 6.41 million families with a full-time housewife. Even so, a private survey last year by the Recruit company of over 1,000 full-time-employed couples found women still end up saddled with 70% of household and childcare chores.

Mr. Trump remarked at Thursday's White House briefing that he's seen that disinfectant \"knocks it (COVID-19) out in a minute. And is there a way you can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning? As you see, it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs -- so it'll be interesting to check that. ... It sounds interesting to me.\" But William Bryan, of the Department of Homeland Security, seemed to shoot the idea down as quickly as it was mentioned, saying it wasn't being considered.

But there is potentially good news for summer — research shows the virus' lifespan is shortened by sunlight, heat and humidity, one administration expert said during Thursday's Coronavirus Task Force briefing. The death toll from COVID-19 in the U.S. is likely to hit 50,000 in a couple of days, and there is no indication the pace of the nation's losses — in terms of both lives and the economy — is about to slow significantly. \"We're winning this and we're gonna win it,\" Mr. Trump said as he opened up the briefing. \"And we're gonna keep watching and we're gonna watch very closely for the invisible enemy.\"  Read more here.

President Trump is now expected to sign the legislation, which lawmakers approved by a vote of 388-5. The legislation, known as the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, is the result of weeks of negotiations between congressional Democrats and the White House. The measure includes $75 billion for hospitals, $25 billion to establish a national testing regime, $60 billion in disaster aid and $310 billion for the  Paycheck Protection Program  (PPP), which provides loans to small businesses to help them retain workers and meet payroll. The PPP exhausted its initial $349 billion in funding last week. The vote comes as new government data shows  4.4 million people  filed initial unemployment claims last week, raising the total number of people who have lost their jobs during the pandemic to about 26 million.

The virus \"dies the quickest in the presence of direct sunlight,\" Bryan told reporters at the Coronavirus Task Force briefing. According to a slide shown at the daily White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing, the virus has a half life of 18 hours on a surface when it's 70-75 degrees, with 20% humidity and no sunlight. But when the humidity rises to 80% and sunlight increases, the virus' half life drops to two minutes. Bryan talked about the existence on playground equipment as an example: In the sunlight, the virus would die very quickly, he said, although parts of the equipment in the shade would not be affected in the same way.

In a statement Saturday morning, WHO warned that antibodies may not adequately protect survivors, leaving them vulnerable to a second coronavirus infection. The warning came as several countries, including the United States, are considering allowing people who have recovered to carry \"immunity passports\" or \"risk-free certificates.\" That documentation would allow survivors to return to work and other activities under the assumption that they are immune from the virus. On Monday, Chile announced its plans to distribute \"health passports\" after screening survivors for antibodies, allowing them to reenter the workforce, Reuters reports. Earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S.' top infectious disease expert, said \"immunity cards\" have been discussed as an option by the Trump administration. WHO pleaded with governments not to issue this type of documentation, saying that it could increase the risk of spreading coronavirus as people relax their protection measures and ignore certain guidance from health officials. \"Some governments have suggested that the detection of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, could serve as the basis for an 'immunity passport' or 'risk-free certificate' that would enable individuals to travel or to return to work assuming that they are protected against re-infection,\" WHO said. \"There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.\"It also said it is concerned about false negative and false positive testing that could make the documentation inaccurate and put more people at risk of infection. \"People who assume that they are immune to a second infection because they have received a positive test result may ignore public health advice,\" WHO said. \"The use of such certificates may therefore increase the risks of continued transmission.\"WHO said it supports antibody testing and is continuing to review research on antibody responses to the virus, which have so far shown that survivors have antibodies to the virus. However, not every survivor has the same levels of antibodies in their blood, \"suggesting that cellular immunity may also be critical for recovery,\" the agency said, adding that the accuracy and reliability of lab tests for antibodies need to be improved.Although there are 120 projects around the world working toward a vaccine, only five have been approved for clinical trials on humans.

Michael O'Leary, CEO of Ryanair, said if the rule is implemented, the government should pay for the empty seats â or his planes will not fly. In an interview with the Financial Times, the budget airline executive explained plans for Ryanair to resume 80% of flights by September as long as flying in Europe could resume in July. O'Leary said the airline intends to gradually increase the number of flights, and then reduce them again in the less busy winter season. But, he said, these plans could be foiled if there were \"some entirely ineffective social distancing measures like having middle seats empty because if middle seats are empty we're not returning to flying at all.\"O'Leary said Ryanair told the government that if it implements such a rule, there will be pushback. \"Either the government pays for the middle seat or we won't fly,\" he told the Financial Times. \"We can't make money on 66 percent load factors. Even if you do that, the middle seat doesn't deliver any social distancing, so it's kind of an idiotic idea that doesn't achieve anything anyway.\"Some airlines, including Delta, have already taken this step to help protect passengers. Starting April 13 through June 30, Delta said it would block middle seats on all flights. Of course, air travel has declined so much amid the current stay-at-home orders that most planes have few passengers anyway.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) claims the risk of catching an infection on a plane is typically lower than in a shopping center or office environment, and recommends common-sense steps to reduce the risk, like washing your hands and not touching your face. These guidelines are consistent with general recommendations from the CDC.However, IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac said leaving the middle seat vacant on flights may become an added preventative measure, Reuters reports. De Juniac acknowledged that more seats filled means more money for airlines, which are struggling right now. \"On the one hand ... you have airlines that are heavily in the red and desperately need passengers to come back, which could put pressure on prices,\" he told Reuters.However, \"if we ask for distancing in the aircraft we will have to neutralize a great number of seats and so it means that ... you need to raise prices,\" he continued, admitting these are two contradictory trends. In his interview with Financial Times, O'Leary said Europe should instead implement other measures, like mandatory mask-wearing and temperature checks. He said he was hopeful that there would be a return to more normal air traffic levels in the summer 2021 once there is an effective coronavirus vaccine. \"I think Ryanair in summer 2021 will be carrying our 2019 traffic plus growth, but the airports will still have less traffic than they had before,\" O'Leary said, although FT reports some aviation analysts predict this could take three years to achieve.O'Leary himself took a 50% pay cut and would continue to do so beyond May, if the lockdown lasted, according to Financial Times. Similarly, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said he would give up his salary for the rest of the year.In the U.S., the nation's six biggest airlines â Delta, American, United, Southwest, Alaska and JetBlue â along with four smaller carriers have have tentatively agreed to terms for $25 billion in federal aid to pay workers and keep them employed through September. ", "section": "World", "bylines": ["Caitlin O'Kane"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "\"Either the government pays for the middle seat or we won't fly,\" Michael O'Leary told the Financial Times.", "originalurl": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ryanair-michael-oleary-social-distancing-middle-seats-idiotic/", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.06024220032840723, "subjectivity": 0.3474548440065681, "wordcount": 588}

Some are asylum-seekers who fled repressive regimes. Others are lawful U.S. permanent residents who were picked up by immigration authorities after serving time in prison. Some are mothers and even grandmothers. Right now, they're all terrified.Like many of the more than 35,000 immigrants currently in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, the women held at the LaSalle detention center in Jena feel powerless to shield themselves from the highly contagious coronavirus, which has killed more than 60,000 people worldwide, including more than 7,000 in the U.S. At least 370 people have died in Louisiana alone, where a recent surge in cases has threatened to overwhelm the state's health care system.With at least eight confirmed cases among detainees nationwide and six among detention center employees, ICE has come under intense pressure to drastically downsize its detainee population to mitigate the risk of outbreaks. But detainees and their advocates fear ICE isn't acting quickly enough. Despite some releases, many of them compelled by a flurry of lawsuits, the agency has resisted calls to implement a nationwide policy of releasing some categories of detainees, including older immigrants, those with chronic medical conditions and asylum-seekers who don't pose a threat to the public.Desperation among detainees has grown. Last week, officials at the Jena facility pepper sprayed women detainees who tried to leave a housing area during a briefing on coronavirus preparations. But seven women who were there said the jail staff failed to address their concerns about lax social distancing and hygiene practices, prompting a small group to start protesting. ICE spokesman Bryan Cox said the four women who were pepper sprayed \"became disruptive and confrontational,\" and \"attempted to physically force their way out.\"The incident last week was one of several in which officials at ICE detention centers used pepper spray to disperse protesting immigrants. The women detained at the Jena jail are alarmed by news reports on Telemundo and Univision announcing rising death tolls in the U.S. every day. Their families tell them how much the pandemic has upended the world outside the walls of their crowded housing area, and they feel trapped and endangered.As the U.S. confronts a public health crisis unlike any it has ever faced, the women at the Jena jail fear the public is forgetting about them â and they are pleading with a crisis-stricken nation to listen to them.\"Give us an opportunity to be with our families. We're mothers,\" Ana, a 46-year-old Dominican immigrant, told CBS News in Spanish during a phone call from the Jena facility. \"Don't let us die like this, as if we were animals. We're human beings.\"\"We can die inside here\"Arlet Victoria RemÃ³n PÃ©rez, 23, has been in U.S. immigration custody since April 2019. But she has never been as scared as she is now. \"We know the virus is killing a lot of people, and we are very susceptible to contracting it,\" RemÃ³n PÃ©rez told CBS News in Spanish. \"Once one person is infected, we're all going to get sick.\"\"If that happens here ... I think many of us will die,\" she added.Before fleeing Cuba, RemÃ³n PÃ©rez finished two years of medical school. She said the staff at the detention center has not taken the necessary steps to protect everyone inside the facility. Access to soap, hand sanitizer and disinfecting equipment is very limited or non-existent, she added. Social distancing, RemÃ³n PÃ©rez said, is impossible, noting that she sleeps in a housing area that holds roughly 80 other women, and the bunk beds are less than a meter apart. Their diet consists mainly of carbohydrates like bread and pasta and lacks nutrient-rich foods to boost their immune systems.RemÃ³n PÃ©rez fled her country last year after being threatened by government security forces because of her father's political advocacy and her identity as a lesbian woman. She and her partner, Eliana HecheverrÃ­a, crisscrossed Central America and Mexico to reach the U.S. southern border, where they were placed on a waiting list to tell U.S. officials about the persecution they fear in Cuba. But after weeks of waiting in Mexico, the motel in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez where they were staying was taken over by drug cartel members, prompting them to cross the U.S. border illegally in April 2019.The couple was detained near El Paso for about two months. They were allowed to shower and brush their teeth every 10 days, RemÃ³n PÃ©rez said. The long hours in the sweltering Texas desert were difficult for RemÃ³n PÃ©rez, who suffers from severe asthma. In June 2019, the couple was transferred to the detention center in Jena.RemÃ³n PÃ©rez does not blame the women who tried to leave the housing area last week â everyone is desperate. \"They were only protesting because we were afraid. It was not fair what they did to those women,\" she said. Cox, the ICE spokesman, said the women were placed in solitary confinement for violating facility rules. \"We're scared because we know we can die inside here,\" RemÃ³n PÃ©rez said. \"The situation does not bode well for us. We don't have a way to protect ourselves. We feel like children who are protected by parents. They are in charge of protecting us â and they are not protecting us.\"Her partner, HecheverrÃ­a, said the only way they will be able to protect themselves from the coronavirus is if ICE releases them. \"I don't feel like the owner of my own life here, because here, I'm completely at risk. Outside, I know how to take care of myself, I know how to protect myself, I know what I have to do to not get infected,\" she added. \"Here, I don't.\" HecheverrÃ­a is particularly worried about the health of her partner. In addition to having chronic asthma and severe allergies, RemÃ³n PÃ©rez said she has not menstruated for seven months. She said a doctor near LaSalle found cysts in one of her ovaries, but that she has yet to be taken to the hospital again to determine whether the cysts are malignant. Cox, from ICE, said he could not discuss RemÃ³n PÃ©rez's medical treatment without her consent. Both RemÃ³n PÃ©rez and HecheverrÃ­a are appealing asylum denials by judges at the Jena immigration court, which has rejected over 90% of the asylum requests it has received this fiscal year, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. They don't have criminal records, but the government won't allow them to continue their proceedings outside detention because it has determined they might fail to show up at their court hearings.Asked about the concerns raised by the seven women interviewed by CBS News, Cox called them \"unsubstantiated rumors.\" He said all meals are developed by a registered dietician and referred CBS News to information on ICE's website about measures taken in response to the pandemic. \"All persons are screened upon arrival at ICE facilities, soap and other appropriate cleaning supplies are provided to those in custody, and all persons in custody are provided necessary and appropriate medical care,\" Cox wrote in a statement.A spokesperson for GEO Group, the private prison company that runs the Jena jail, said staff have taken \"comprehensive steps\" to mitigate the risk posed by the coronavirus pandemic. \"We strongly reject these unfounded allegations, which we believe are being instigated by outside groups with political agendas,\" the spokesperson added.\"They're desperate to get out of here\"Last week, Marlene Seo, 48, watched a television news segment that discussed extraordinary efforts people are undertaking for their pets during the pandemic. She seemed stricken. \"They get a thought aired on TV and news, yet the immigrants don't,\" Seo told CBS News during a phone call. \"If our congressmen and everybody, even the president, is talking about humanity, and us keeping together and doing the best that we can to help each other, why are we not being treated in that sense?\"ICE said it has implemented screening protocols for new detainees. But Seo said the constant flow of people, both immigrants and staff, entering and leaving the jail in Jena is what concerns her the most. \"People keep coming in and out. They'll deport people,\" she said. \"And they'll take them out and they'll bring them back within a week because there are no flights.\"Seo said the staff has not provided detainees cleaning supplies, despite repeated requests, and social distancing is not being enforced. She has noticed staff working while sick.\"Everything that applies to everyone on the outside doesn't apply to us in here,\" Seo added. \"We are allowed to be 80 [people] grouped together, sneezing, coughing.\"Unlike most of the immigrants at Jena, which holds roughly 1,200 ICE detainees, Seo speaks fluent English. She was born in Mexico but has lived in the U.S. since she was 3 years old. The green card holder was arrested by ICE upon completing a year-long prison sentence for filing a false corporate income tax return. Like other permanent residents at Jena and other ICE detention centers, Seo continues to be detained beyond her criminal sentence because the government wants to deport her to Mexico. \"I don't know Mexico. I've never been to Mexico,\" she said. \"I've been here all my life.\"Seo is determined to try to stay in the U.S. and return to her family in Denver, especially now, during the pandemic, but she said the past couple of months have been difficult. \"It's been too long. I've missed my granddaughter's birthday. I missed two granddaughters being born.\" She has found some solace in helping the other women detainees. The grandmother said the women at the detention center turn to her when making requests to ICE because she speaks and writes English fluently. Many immigrants and asylum-seekers who have been detained for months and even years, Seo said, have recently been requesting that ICE send them to their home countries or allow them to pay for their own flights to leave the U.S.\"They're desperate to get out of here,\" she said. Kenni, 25, is one of those women who has grown increasingly desperate. Last week, she was placed in solitary confinement after the pepper spray incident. Because Kenni applied for asylum at an official border crossing after waiting for three months in northern Mexico, the young Cuban asylum-seeker is not eligible for bond in immigration court. The ICE field office in New Orleans, which has been sued for its very low parole approval rate in recent years, has also denied her request for parole. \"It's been seven months of imprisonment without having committed any crime,\" Kenni said. She's scared of contracting the coronavirus while in detention, and like the other women at Jena, there's no sign she'll be freed.", "section": "U.S.", "bylines": ["Camilo Montoya-Galvez"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "Immigrant women detained in rural Louisiana feel powerless to shield themselves from the rapidly-spreading coronavirus.

In a different order last month, Gee called immigration detention centers \"hotbeds of contagion.\"The order applies to the approximately 2,100 unaccompanied minors in ORR custody, as well as the 342 children held with their families at the three ICE family detention centers. The government has released hundreds of migrant children since Gee issued a temporary restraining order in March requiring their quick release under the parameters of the Flores agreement. But on Friday, Gee said \"greater speed\" is needed to remove more minors from congregate settings.Gee required both ICE and the U.S. refugee agency to \"make every effort to promptly and safely\" release the children in their custody who have sponsors, don't pose a danger to themselves or others and are not flight risks. She prohibited the agencies from using certain justifications to continue detaining minors.Gee said the U.S. refugee agency can't block the release of children with sponsors simply because they were formerly in Mexico with their family under the Migrant Protection Protocols and have a pending case linked to that program. Some parents returned to Mexico under the MPP policy have sent their children to seek asylum alone at the U.S. southern border, since unaccompanied minors can't be placed in the program, per government policy. ICE, meanwhile, can't justify not releasing families with children because they are named in federal litigation or due to the fact that they are waiting for a decision by an immigration judge or for officials to adjudicate their credible fear screenings, the first step in the asylum process.Gee also ordered the U.S. refugee agency to temporarily waive the fingerprint requirement for some immediate family members, distant relatives and unrelated adults seeking to sponsor unaccompanied migrant minors. While coronavirus shelter in place orders remain in effect, she said officials can release minors to these sponsors without fingerprinting them if that is not available, as long as red flags don't show up in their background checks. The sponsors also have to agree to submit fingerprints \"as soon as practicable.\"Friday's order stems from a request by lawyers involved in the decades-long Flores litigation for Gee to order the government to rapidly release all children with sponsors. This week, the attorneys said the release of minors is particularly urgent as the coronavirus continues to spread throughout facilities for detained immigrants. At least 59 migrant children in ORR-overseen facilities in New York, Texas, Illinois and Pennsylvania have tested positive for coronavirus, according to the agency's latest tally. ICE has not reported any cases at the three family detention centers in Texas and Pennsylvania, but has identified at least 317 positive coronavirus test results among adults in its custody and 35 among direct detention center employees, as of Friday.The U.S. refugee agency has discharged hundreds of children in recent weeks, with the number of minors in its care dwindling from more than 3,500 in early March to the current 2,100 in-custody population. But the agency has also been receiving very few children from border officials, who are now expelling most unauthorized migrants, including minors who arrive at the border alone, by invoking expansive turn-back powers under a public health order they say is designed to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Gee said ICE deserved \"some credit\" for moving away from a \"laggardly initial response\" and implementing a \"rapidly-evolving response to the pandemic\" in the wake of the litigation by the children's lawyers. She also said she appreciated that ICE has released dozens of families in recent weeks. But she said the children's lawyers, through first-hand accounts from detained immigrants, have undercut the \"optimistic portrait\" of the agency's efforts to maintain \"safe and sanitary\" conditions for children, another Flores Settlement requirement.Declarations by ICE \"paint a picture of sanitary, social-distance-compliant, and medically appropriate facilities,\" but that picture is \"tarnished by declarations of detainees and their legal services providers,\" Gee said.\"(Immigrants) report inaccessible or ineffective medical treatment, deteriorating health while in custody, insufficient soap and sanitation supplies, lack of thorough cleaning by staff, and insufficient use of (personal protective equipment) by staff or detainees,\" Gee wrote in her order.Peter Schey, one of the two attorneys who filed the original lawsuit that prompted the Flores agreement, praised Friday's order.  \"I think Judge Gee's order will result in an acceleration of the release of both accompanied and unaccompanied minors in the coming days and weeks as the judge made very clear the government's current policies are in breach of the settlement,\" Schey, the president of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, told CBS News.\"The order will put pressure on them to not slow down their releases of children in light of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" Schey added.In her order, Gee also required court-appointed juvenile coordinators at ICE and the U.S. refugee agency to file monthly reports starting in May on the agencies' efforts to expedite the release of children and to protect them during the pandemic.An ICE spokesperson said the agency is reviewing Friday's order.

But some medical experts interviewed by CBS News question some of the administration's claims about whether China's lack of transparency is actually blocking the world from developing a vaccine. In a series of interviews, Pompeo reeled off a list of accusations against Beijing including that it had deliberately destroyed early samples of the virus rather than share them with the world. \"It covered up how dangerous the disease is. It didn't report sustained human-to-human transmission for a month until it was in every province inside of China,\" he told State Department reporters on Wednesday. \"It censored those who tried to warn the world, it ordered a halt to testing of new samples, and it destroyed existing samples.\" \"We need our scientists, our academics, our epidemiologists all to have access to the data, access to a sample of the virus,\" Pompeo told Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday. \"Those are all things that matter so that we can solve this problem, get our country back to work, and save lives.\" Chinese researchers in Shanghai first shared the genetic sequence of SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, National Center for Biotechnology Information's website on January 5. According to the U.S. State Department, China then shared with the WHO a genetic sequence taken from a January 4 patient infected with the virus, which was published on January 12 by the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). A senior State Department official told CBS News that disclosure is not enough. \"It is critical to obtain live virus samples to understand how the virus evolved, and how to develop effective and safe therapeutics and vaccines.\" The official also said that producing a vaccine only using a genetic sequence \"introduces the risk of mutations, and the possibility that the reproduced virus (from which to develop a vaccine) doesn't mirror the virus circulating in the population.\" But medical experts tell CBS News they are skeptical of the need at this point for early virus samples to develop a vaccine and treatments. \"The fact that there isn't an actual replicating vial of virus is not a problem, as long as you have this sequence of what was in that tube,\" said Dr. Andy Pekosz of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He explained that there has been no problem tracking the virus' evolution. \"There's now hundreds upon hundreds of sequences from viruses in that early stage of China that have been made available.\" Medical scientists around the world have since been sharing the mutated sequences of the coronavirus online. \"Based on what I've seen from the databases, there's a really good amount of data there that is helping us drive forward not just vaccine work but even helping us just understand how the virus is spreading from country to country.\"  \"If we had more data in the beginning of January, it would have been helpful and could have made a difference,\" said CBS News medical contributor Dr. David Agus. \"But now it doesn't make a difference.\"\"Is this a way to say 'China is bad, because they're not giving us the viral sample'? Of course,\" Agus said of the domestic political benefit to such a public spat. \"But scientifically, I can't think of a reason why, because we have so much data of the virus from then 'til now shared from so many countries.\"Epidemiologist Dr. Jonna Mazet of UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine had a similar assessment. \"I don't think it is essential that the first samples â   if they exist â   be shared at this point, since there is ample virus in almost every country from which to sample for vaccine and therapeutic development,\" she said.She acknowledged that early virus samples would help clarify the timeline and location of the first cases of infection, environmental contamination by the virus, the original animal host and the virus spillover into humans. But she added, \"It's probably not that important at this point.\"The timing of what China did disclose about the virus, specifically the human-to-human transmission of it, is a key issue in the ongoing dispute about U.S. funding to the World Health Organization. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA Commissioner, said that if China had been more transparent with what it knew about the virus earlier on in the outbreak it could have made a difference in diagnostic testing capabilities.\"China didn't share the viral strains and the WHO. should have made them do that,\" he said on Face the Nation on April 12. \"Had they share those early on, we could have developed a diagnostic test earlier, validated earlier.\"Another point of dispute with China has been determining whether the source of the earliest strain of the virus was truly a wet market in Wuhan, a naturally occurring transmission from animal to human, or the result of a lab accident. Mazet collaborated for a decade with Wuhan-based Chinese virologist Dr. Shi Zhengli on the USAID-funded 'PREDICT' project, an epidemiological research program that was developing an early warning pandemic system for infectious diseases, including for coronaviruses. Shi has conducted extensive research on bat coronaviruses, including discovering the closest known strain to the virus behind SARs. The program was terminated by the Trump administration in September 2019. Chinese doctors reported the first cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in December.Mazet said that Shi â nicknamed 'bat woman' by her colleagues â has since been accused of accidentally spreading the virus from her lab at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Shi told Scientific American in March that she had checked and was relieved to confirm that the coronavirus causing COVID-19 was not among her collection. Efforts by CBS News to contact Shi have been unsuccessful.China's failures, in Mazet's view, were not lab security, but a \"slow response to the early warning signs and not ramping up all of the health systems, including testing, right away.\"The Trump administration is not alone in criticizing how China initially responded. Australia is calling for an international investigation focusing on the origins of the virus in China, and the World Health Organization's handling of it. In January, the WHO praised China's transparency in dealing with the virus, and repeated Chinese claims that there was no human-to-human transmission.In mid-February, the WHO said that 25 of its investigators were permitted into China to study the virus. That team was shown lung and other tissue samples from a 50-year-old Chinese victim of the virus according to the WHO report.CBS News asked the U.S. Health and Human Services whether this would have been an opportunity to collect a virus sample. Dr. Cliff Lane, one of only two Americans on that WHO visit, said in a statement, \"I am not aware of samples being shared in conjunction with the WHO visit.\" He further characterized the WHO report as describing an autopsy and not \"an exchange of materials.\" An HHS spokesperson also confirmed that the U.S. still has not received any virus samples since that February WHO visit.China's ambassador to the U.S., Cui Tiankai, said in an interview this week, \"We have shared everything we have learned with the WHO, and the medical communities of other countries including the United States.\" He also said that there has been ongoing communication between both the U.S. CDC and Chinese CDC.Pompeo's statement on Wednesday that China had destroyed samples was the first time a senior U.S. official made that accusation on the record. Unverified reports have circulated online for weeks.Mazet told CBS News she was unaware of what happened to the first virus samples taken from patients in China. Either way, she explained, clinical virus samples taken from infected bodies are not easy to preserve and therefore not ideal from which to develop a vaccine.She added that the whole point of infectious disease scientists collecting dangerous viruses in the field is to better prepare for a crisis like this. \"In research, we take care to collect extra samples and preserve them in ways that helps them be useful later, but that rarely happens in a clinical setting, especially early on in an outbreak of unknown origin. That's something else that can be fixed with pre-planning for Disease-X.\" In the meantime, this ongoing dispute about what the Chinese Communist Party or any government should be expected to share about an outbreak will continue as countries around the globe continue to reel from the impact of this mysterious, lethal virus.", "section": "Politics", "bylines": ["Margaret Brennan"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "Medical experts interviewed by CBS News question some of the administration's claims about whether China's lack of transparency is actually is blocking the world from developing a vaccine.", "originalurl": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/state-department-says-coronavirus-samples-from-china-critical-for-developing-vaccine-experts-say-thats-not-the-case/", "previousfetches": 0, "sentiment": 0.05120386486365867, "subjectivity": 0.35728790110233405, "wordcount": 1458}

That would make Ashford the country's largest known beneficiary of the small business rescue fund if it were to receive all the loan money for which it has applied. Car dealership chain AutoNation, a Fortune 500 company with $21 billion in revenue, said it had been approved to receive nearly $80 million from the Paycheck Protection Program to hire back 7,000 laid-off employees at local dealerships before the Florida-based company announced Friday it would return the money. Ashford and its hotel affiliates have received nearly half the amount applied for as of Friday, according to financial filings. That roughly $60 million received is far larger than the recent average small business loan amount of $206,000 lent by the Paycheck Protection Program before it ran out of nearly $350 billion in initial funding after just two weeks. It is also nearly 13 times the $10 million maximum that each borrower was allowed to receive from the fund. But hotels, restaurants and other franchisees were allowed to apply for the loans for their individual locations, as long as those locations had less than 500 employees each. That exemption is still allowed in a second tranche of $310 billion in small business loans that Congress voted this past week to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program. Hundreds of thousands of business borrowers ended up getting shut out of receiving funds from the first round. The PPP is expected to restart lending on Monday morning.AutoNation, Shake Shack, Ruth's Chris Steak House and several other large companies facing withering public criticism have announced they will give back the money they received from the Paycheck Protection Program. On Thursday, the Treasury Department issued new guidance for the program strongly discouraging public companies from applying for assistance. The guidance said PPP loans were not intended for companies that have been able to raise money elsewhere. It said public companies that had already received PPP loans and would not be eligible under the new guidance had until May 7 to return the money and not face any penalties.Ashford, however, said in its statement Saturday it believes it still qualifies for the program. It said other government assistance, included an emergency lending program from the Federal Reserve, were not available to it because of its previous borrowing. Still, Ashford said it will review any loans it had received and return any money from loans that no longer qualify by the Treasury's May 7 deadline.The company said 32 of its 130 hotels have been completely shuttered during the coronavirus crisis. Its top executives, including CEO Bennett, have taken pay cuts. Bennett told CBS MoneyWatch last month that his company, which was started by his father, had been forced to lay off or furlough nearly 6,500 workers.\"There is no money to make our debt service,\" Bennett told CBS MoneyWatch at the time. \"We can't make the numbers work. No one can.\"Ashford said it plans to use the majority of its PPP money bringing back its thousands of furloughed workers. But Ashford said in another part of the statement on Saturday it expected only a small portion of the loan money it had received from the Paycheck Protection Program would end up being eligible for forgiveness. Companies that use at least 75% of the money lent through the program on paying workers for eight weeks rather than letting them go can have their entire PPP loan forgiven, as well as the low 1% interest.\"Our singular focus is to get back to the business of hosting guests at our hotels and helping the nearly 14,000 employees who work at our 130 hotels and related businesses return to work as the economy emerges from this terrible crisis,\" the company said in the statement.", "section": "MoneyWatch", "bylines": ["Stephen Gandel"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "Ashford and its subsidiaries have applied for more than $125 million in loans and received nearly $60 million so far.", "originalurl": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ashford-monty-bennett-paycheck-protection-program-keeping-small-business-coronavirus-relief-aid/", "previousfetches": 0, "sentiment": -0.01648185148185148, "subjectivity": 0.3566050616050615, "wordcount": 784}

Ports are closed and supply chains disrupted as a disaster looms for millions.David Beasley, the executive director of the United Nations World Food Program and a former governor of South Carolina, said in an interview with CBS News that members of both parties in the U.S. have come together to help stave off poverty, starvation and instability, but he says more aid is needed to keep food supplies moving. He also spoke about the need for \"common sense\" on when to reopen the economy.Beasley spoke with CBS News' Pamela Falk from his home in Society Hill, South Carolina, where he recently recuperated from a case of COVID-19 himself.CBS News' Pamela Falk: You came down with coronavirus. Tell us what the experience was like.David Beasley: You read all stories, then when it hits you, it's a whole different ballgame.I've been lucky, in the sense that it never got so severe that I had to go to the hospital. But at the same time it didn't hit me for three days. It was real slight and went away completely ... it hit me with a little fever, aches and pains. And then I thought it was going away after three days, and then it â¦ it just kept lingering for three straight weeks. ... Fortunately I never had respiratory issues. I was worried one particular day, but made a good turn, and it's behind me now.I'm so gratefulâ¦ that I can speak with experience about what I faced so that people can understand what this is all about.Even when governors or leaders say we're going to open up, still use common sense. That's the key: use common sense, use the brain that God has given you. And be careful.This is a deadly disease. Even if it's not deadly for you, you can give it to someone who might be elderly or with a pre-existing condition, and then that obviously is deadly.The World Food Program warned that, in addition to the coronavirus pandemic, the world may see a global humanitarian catastrophe. What is your message to world leaders, to the private sector? What can be done?Beasley: This is tragic. We feed about 100 million people on any given day, but 30 million depend on us 100%. So now with COVID, we've got an additional 130 million people bringing us to 265 million people literally marching to the brink of starvation.We got to work out these issues immediately. Otherwise we're going to have famines unlike anything we've ever seen in history.Number one: Let's end the wars right now. Please end the wars â that would be the biggest thing. Number two: We need to pre-position about $1.9 billion worth of food â¦ to advance that funding so we can pre-position it so that when supply chains begin to break down, people won't lose their lives because of what we do. Number three: We need about $350 million so that we can move medical supplies, testing kits, doctors, nurses and health care professionals.The last thing we need to do is keep the supply chain going because if you can't get the food out of a field to the market to the consumer, people will die.I tell you, the worst is yet to come.I'm so concerned about Africa. Obviously I'm concerned about our donor nations â that their economies get back to moving as quickly as they can, so that we can provide the monies that are going to be needed to stave off massive famine in many of these countries that depend on success in the economies of donor nations like the United States, like the U.K., like Germany.Many Africans depend upon remittances from their friends and families from around the world, like from the United States. And if we start seeing in urban areas of Africa youth losing their jobs, and not having food, you're going to have riots.Destabilization is going to be a game-changer. So we're trying to identify the hotspots upfront and see what we can do to come in with safety nets, but we're going to need funding to do that. If we don't, it'll be catastrophic.Are you speaking to the U.S. administration, to the Trump administration, about keeping ports open?Beasley: Yes, I've been talking to not just the U.S. administration but literally leaders from many countries all over the earth. And I can tell you â¦ that the United States has been an extraordinary donor. In fact we get about $3.4 billion from the United States.Republicans and Democrats, even though they seem to be fighting over everything, when it comes to food security foreign aid and stabilization, they have been absolutely remarkable and every leader that I have talked to, including the United States, is committed to working with us doing their dead-level best not to back down.This is the 75th anniversary of the UN. Do you think [the next General Assembly, in September] could take place?Beasley: This year is one of the most devastating years in the United Nations history. So this would be a year for everybody really coming together because COVID has transcended all borders around the world.  So it'd be a great time for leaders to come together for a variety of reasons. However, if COVID is still a contagious issue, I would imagine we might see the first UN General Assembly as a virtual show.A final note:  Asked about being back home in South Carolina to recuperate, Beasley said he's able to walk around and get fresh air. \"My family's lived in this area since the early 1700s so we're an old family that came across like we were, we were immigrants, way back when,\" he said.", "section": "World", "bylines": ["Pamela Falk"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "David Beasley talked to CBS News about the risk of famine amid the pandemic, the need for \"common sense\" on reopening the economy, and his own recovery from COVID-19.", "originalurl": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-famine-world-food-program-david-beasley/", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.0700811419095001, "subjectivity": 0.4275645581615731, "wordcount": 972}

Radium & RadonLate one November evening in 1927, Eben Byers â a forty-seven-year-old industrialist, socialite, and ladies' man â fell from his berth in his private chartered train.That night he'd been in an exuberant mood, having just watched Yale, his alma mater, defeat Harvard in their annual football match. Buoyed by his team's win, Byers launched the kind of party only a wealthy playboy could host on a private train in the Roaring Twenties (aka the kind of party we all wish we could attend every Friday night).During the late-night revelry, Byers took a bad fall and injured his arm. When the pain remained with him several days later in the comfort of his mansion, he turned to his handsomely paid physicians. They were stumped. Despite their best efforts, Byers's arm pain would not subside. The injury had a detrimental effect on his serious golf game. (He had won the US Amateur Championship twenty-one years earlier, in 1906.)Worse for the wealthy playboy, the injury dampened his raging libido. The notorious womanizer was desperate for solutions. At a loss, one of Byers's physicians suggested he try a new patent medicine called Radithor. Manufactured by Bailey Radium Laboratory in New Jersey, each bottle of Radithor was guaranteed to contain two microcuries of radium, the new kid on the medical block and still blossoming with potential. Radithor was widely advertised as a cure-all for some 150 maladies, including dyspepsia, high blood pressure, and impotence. It also didn't hurt that the doctor, along with every other physician who prescribed Radithor, received a generous 17 percent kickback from the manufacturer.Byers began taking the medicine. When his arm pain improved, he became convinced that Radithor had increased his vitality. He began drinking three bottles of Radithor a day in December 1927, three times the recommended daily amount. It was a luxury unique to his financial situation because the average person couldn't afford to keep up that kind of dosage. And that was a good thing â by 1931, the industrialist had built up radiation dosage levels equivalent to receiving several thousand X-rays.Unfortunately for Byers, this level of radiation didn't turn him into a Marvel superhero. It slowly â and gruesomely â killed him.Behold, the Power of Radium!Famously discovered and isolated by Marie and Pierre Curie â who ultimately gave their health, and in Marie's case, her life, for this scientific breakthrough â radium was embraced by the medical community of the early twentieth century for its striking ability to destroy cancerous cells. Of course, the problem with radium is that it's less like a heat-seeking missile and more like a nuclear bomb. It can affect any cell it encounters, cancerous or not.Before the dangers of radium were fully understood, however, the element enjoyed a brief life (half-life?) as the celebrity element du jour. In 1902, the Curies first isolated radium chloride from a uranium-rich mineral and ore now called \"uranite.\" (A quick primer: As uranium decomposes, it transforms into other elements. Radium is just a stop on the one-way decomposition train from uranium to lead.) The new element, which Marie called \"my beautiful radium,\" glowed with both radioactivity and medical promise. Radium had a half-life of sixteen hundred years and had a radioactivity level of about three thousand times that of uranium. It was enormously rare and enormously intriguing. (And enormously dangerous, but we'll get to that later.)Less than a year later, while commenting on radium's ability to cause deep flesh burns, Pierre Curie suggested that it might have potential to treat cancer. Initial results were very promising, particularly with skin cancers. The next year, 1904, saw John MacLeod, a physician at Charing Cross Hospital in London, developing radium applicators for treatment of internal cancers as well, which shrank tumors.It's difficult to overstate the importance of that discovery. After losing the war against cancer for centuries, we finally had an ally. And it even glowed! So it was no surprise that, in addition to treating cancer, physicians in the early twentieth century experimented with using radium for hypertension, diabetes, arthritis, rheumatism, gout, and tuberculosis.Despite the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906, radium remained entirely unregulated because it was classified as a natural element rather than as a drug. And so quacks across the country began exploiting radium's mysterious qualities for their own gain. (Advertisements sprang up in newspapers: \"Radiate Youth and Beauty,\" \"Radium is Restoring Health to Thousands,\" and \"Remarkable New Radium Cream Liniment Drives Out Pain from Aching Joints and Muscles Instantly!\")The only saving grace was that radium was extremely expensive because of its scarcity. As a result, the vast majority of radioactive products peddled by quacks around the United States did not actually contain any radioactive ingredients at all, a quirk of the supply and demand process that undoubtedly saved hundreds, perhaps thousands, of lives.Radon, the Revigator, and Other CrocksThe first wave of radioactive products to hit over-the-counter markets were water based. Medical opinion had landed on radon (the gas produced by decomposing radium) as the curative, life-giving property in hot springs that were popular around the turn of the twentieth century â especially the famous springs in Arkansas. No one really knew what it was about the hot springs that made them curative, but once the presence of radon was identified, it wasn't much of a leap to assume that radioactivity was responsible. Radon, however, had a serious problem. It can only temporarily remain in water before it either decays or evaporates into the air.Today, we explicitly try to remove radon from our drinking water (obviously). But in the early twentieth century, a lively trade sprang up in devices built to do the exact opposite. In addition to soaking in radon-laced pools, many people believed drinking radioactive water was generally a good idea, sort of the equivalent of downing a green drink today. One of the most successful devices to add radon to water was the Revigator, invented by R. W. Thomas and patented in 1912. The Revigator was described as a \"radioactive water crock,\" which was essentially true â it was a large jar made of radium-containing uranium ore with an attached spigot. Consumers were instructed to fill the jar every night and \"drink freely,\" averaging between six and seven glasses each day. The Revigator became your very own home radioactive spring, guaranteed to produce a \"health-giving drink.\" And if you had any leftover water at the end of the day? Advertisements encouraged consumers to water their plants!One of the problems with the Revigator â besides slowly poisoning people with about five times the radium concentration recommended for drinking water â was its lack of portability. Several similar but smaller devices sprang onto the market, including the Thomas Cone, the Zimmer Emanator, and the Radium Emanator, all of which operated on the similar principle that you simply plopped them into water you were about to drink. (These devices, collectively dubbed \"emanators,\" were typically manufactured from carnotite ore, a primary ore of uranium. The uranium would gradually decompose, producing radium and radon gas in turn, which then infused the water to make it radioactive.)At last, you could make radioactive water anywhere. Traveling salesmen could rest assured that their drinking water at night in their roadside motel was suitably irradiated.As the relationship between radon and radium began to be understood more clearly (in terms of radioactive potency, radium is basically radon squared), it wasn't long before manufacturers began to release products allowing consumers to directly consume radium or apply it to their skin. Throughout the 1920s, a variety of radium-based cosmetics were released on the market, including beauty creams, salves, soaps, and toothpaste. Yes, toothpaste. It wasn't enough to have white teeth in the 1920s; those little pearls had to glow.Excerpted from \"Quackery: A Brief History of the Worst Ways to Cure Everything\" by Lydia Kang, M.D. and Nate Pedersen.

The Broad Committee for the Search for Equity, a local LGBTQ group, identified them as 32-year-old Serena Angelique VelÃ¡zquez Ramos and 21-year-old Layla Pelaez SÃ¡nchez.VelÃ¡zquez Ramos' sister, Francheska Alvarado, told CBS News she logged onto Facebook Wednesday and saw posts saying,\"I'm sorry for what happened\" and \"We are going to miss you\" on her sibling's page. She didn't think much of it until their mutual friends began to text her, asking her to check up on VelÃ¡zquez, who she hadn't spoken to in over a week. She texted her sister, but never got a text back.  She later learned of her death through a phone call. \"I was in complete shock and disbelief because my sister was a great person,\" Alvarado said. \"She was never in the streets. She was just herself.\" VelÃ¡zquez Ramos, who lived in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico, will be remembered for \"her courage and determination to pursue her dreams and personal desires,\" according to her sister. \"She was a strong soul.\" While the world is mostly confined indoors because of the coronavirus pandemic, Alvarado expressed how helpless she feels from Nashville, Tennessee. She said it's virtually \"impossible\" to travel and be with her mother and grandmother in Puerto Rico during these trying times. \"My family is in deep sorrow, in shock,\" she said. \"We were not expecting this whatsoever.\"Police said they're investigating whether the double murder was a hate crime. To Alvarado, she believes it was. \"We don't have details and I want to know what happened to my sister because justice has to be served,\" she said. \"This cannot continue to happen in Puerto Rico, where people are just killing others because they are not in acceptance with LGBTQ community and other people who are different.\"She also wants police to look into an alleged Snapchat video that shows her sister, Pelaez SÃ¡nchez and two men lying on her bed hours before they were found murdered. Police said it was part of the investigation. The killings come just two months after a homeless transgender woman known as Alexa who was harassed and gunned down in Puerto Rico. Video on social media showed her being threatened before gunshots were heard. So far, no one has been charged in Alexa's death.Gay rights activist Pedro Julio Serrano told CBS News' David Begnaud on Thursday on Instagram Live that life for trans people on the island is \"troubling.\"  \"We are seeing an increase in anti-trans murders,\" Serrano said. \"And we haven't seen this in probably more than 20 years that I have been an activist. We haven't seen this type of violence against trans people in Puerto Rico.\" \"There's homelessness, because we saw this with Alexa,\" he added. \"She was a homeless trans woman who was criminalized for going to the bathroom and that was what triggered the hunting that led to her killing. We saw that there are lack of opportunities. Unemployment based on gender and sexual orientation... There's housing problems that we have... They don't have support services to help them.\" Serrano claims transphobia was a factor in the police investigation of Alexa's murder. \"We're afraid that now this might happen with the murder of Serena and Layla, who were murdered in Humacao yesterday,\" he said. \"It's a critical juncture that trans people are experiencing in Puerto Rico.\" In addition to the deaths of VelÃ¡zquez and Pelaez SÃ¡nchez, a 19-year-old trans man named Yampi MÃ©ndez Arocho was killed in Moca last March. Overall, there have been eight killings involving the transgender community in the United States, according to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC). \"HRC is mourning alongside the loved ones of Serena and Layla, the people of Puerto Rico and the entire transgender community. Serena and Layla, like us all, had family, dreams, hopes â and they did not deserve to die,\" said Tori Cooper, HRC's director of community engagement for the Transgender Justice Initiative. \"Transgender and gender non-conforming people, especially women of color, are too often the victims of a toxic mix of transphobia, racism and misogyny. People and policy must work together to protect our lives and our well-being.\"", "section": "U.S.", "bylines": ["Christopher Brito"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "Their killings would be the third and fourth against transgender people in the last two months.", "originalurl": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/transgender-women-puerto-rico-bodies-serena-angelique-velazquez-layla-pelaez-sanchez/", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.03292724542724542, "subjectivity": 0.41940690690690696, "wordcount": 769}

But he's also seeking guidance from the Re-Open Florida Task Force, which is expected to submit recommendations to him in the next week. \"If you look at that Phase One that the president has laid out, it's not terribly different from what we're doing now,\" he said at Saturday's press conference at the Florida Cleveland Clinic in Weston. He drew some clear lines between his preferred approach and the White House's plan, which includes guidance on social distancing in restaurants, theaters and sports venues. \"We're not doing in-person sports yet no matter what,\" DeSantis said. \"That's just not going to happen in May. Another thing in Phase One, they say movie theaters with social distance. I'm not there yet on the movie theaters. It's an enclosed environment.

In a video posted to YouTube Friday, Newton said he had spoken to the office of the attorney general, and that it did not require him to make any changes. In guidance posted online by the Texas Division of Emergency Management, a document states in bold and underlined print, that dining \"inside\" is what Abbott's order prohibits. Specific language of the order also indicates that it only supersedes local orders that restrict businesses that should be allowed to operate. It does not mention how it affects local orders that expand those services. Colleyville's order also allowed salons and gyms to re-open by appointment, and with customers maintaining distancing. Few if any of those establishments appeared to be open in the city Friday. One gym owner told CBS Dallas / Fort Worth there were still too many variables and requirements to safely re-open.

They get record ratings, & the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time & effort!\" The White House has been doing damage control since Thursday, when Mr. Trump  speculated at the briefing  about ingesting disinfectant to treat coronavirus.

The pressure campaign comes as the U.S. and China wage an information war over the origins and blame for COVID-19, and race to develop a vaccine. But some medical experts interviewed by CBS News question some of the administration's claims about whether China's lack of transparency is actually blocking the world from developing a vaccine. In a series of interviews, Pompeo reeled off a list of accusations against Beijing including that it had deliberately destroyed early samples of the virus rather than share them with the world.  \"It covered up how dangerous the disease is. It didn't report sustained human-to-human transmission for a month until it was in every province inside of China,\" he told State Department reporters on Wednesday. \"It censored those who tried to warn the world, it ordered a halt to testing of new samples, and it destroyed existing samples.\"  Read more  here .                                                                              By Margaret Brennan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-943cb0c0                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       2:46 PM / April 25, 2020              Boston restaurants can now sell grocery items and paper products                                                            Restaurants in Boston will now be allowed to sell grocery items, including produce and paper products, as people continue to social distance during the coronavirus crisis,  CBS Boston reports.  Mayor Marty Walsh said this has been requested by both restaurants and customers and could cut down on essential trips outside the home. Restaurants will have to follow strict safety guidelines, limit occupancy to 10 people at any given time, and maintain six feet between staff and customers. \"By allowing restaurants to also sell grocery and other essential items, we can help address social distancing concerns in grocery stores while supporting restaurants and food businesses during these unprecedented times,\" Walsh said. The new temporary policy will allow the grocery items to be sold via delivery, curbside pickup, and takeout \"I think it's been a tough time for every restaurant in the city,\" said Lynn MacDonald, the regional manager of Earls Kitchen and Bar. \"We are extremely grateful for Mayor Walsh's decision.\"                                                                             By Sarah Lynch Baldwin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-27fb08dd                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       2:33 PM / April 25, 2020              Chicago launches homemade cloth mask drive                                                            The City of Chicago is collecting donations of homemade masks for people who need them, and they still need help making them,  CBS Chicago reports.  The city has launched a campaign called \"Chicago Together!

This will be the first time since World War II that California won't have a state fair.  It was scheduled to take place from July 17 to August 2 at Cal Expo.  \"Canceling this summer's California State Fair is the right thing to do, and is in line with the measured, scientific approach that's been implemented by the governor and health officials to fight COVID-19,\" said Cal Expo General Manager and CEO Rick Pickering in a statement.  Cal Expo generates more than $300 million a year into the local economy and the state fair is a large portion of that. It's a major financial loss, but Pickering says the emotional loss is worse.  \"There's hundreds of thousands of participants that enjoy coming out and making memories that last a lifetime,\" Pickering said.

Although open to people for walking and jogging while observing social distancing and wearing masks, city parks workers will be on-site to watch for overcrowding and prohibited activities such as organized sports. The city is also asking people to wear gloves while in the parks. \"We closed the parks early on to keep people safe, which helped slow the spread of the virus,\" said Mayor Steven Fulop. \"After nearly two months of quarantine, there's also a mental and physical health aspect that needs to be considered, and we know we can't ask our residents, who rely on parks for outdoor access, to stay inside indefinitely.\"                                                                             By Sarah Lynch Baldwin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-6d510691                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       12:54 PM / April 25, 2020              There's \"no evidence\" coronavirus survivors can't be reinfected, WHO says                                                            The World Health Organization said there is \"no evidence\" that survivors of  COVID-19  cannot be reinfected with the virus.

Today I would expect almost double that.\" Orange County is the only county in the area where beaches remain open, as counties north and south of it have shut down their public spaces in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. California Governor Gavin Newsom has temporarily closed some of the state's parks and beaches to the public, and closed vehicle access at all 280 state parks. People aren't restricted from going to beaches that remain open under the states stay-at-home order issued back in March.

Around 20,000 tests are being conducted in the state per day, but Cuomo said the goal is to increase the number of tests to 40,000 daily. Cuomo also said he is expanding the criteria for a person to obtain a diagnostic test. Cuomo said the state was conducting antibody testing for health care workers in four New York City hospitals. Next week, transit workers and state and city police will also receive antibody testing. He also during his daily briefing that the number of new coronavirus cases ticked down on Friday, with around 1,100 new cases. \"Only in this crazy reality would 1,100 be relatively good news, right?\" Cuomo said. He also announced that 437 people died on Friday, a slight uptick from Thursday's death toll. \"Just when you think you're going to have a good day, this reality slaps you in the face,\" Cuomo said.

Boing officials told \"CBS This Morning\" that the health and safety of employees and their families is their priority, and their precautionary measures are based on federal and state guidance. \"I am glad that the Boeing company is committing to very robust social distancing protocols and use of PPE,\" Washington Governor Jay Inslee said, according to CBS News' Kris Van Cleave.  Some of the other protocols in place include temperature checks, enhanced cleaning procedures and staggered shifts to reduce crowding when people arrive and leave. The company will also be issuing masks for workers who must be close together. Boeing said it would be using  contact tracing  should an employee come down with COVID-19.

It's one of the safety measures being taken in an unprecedented Maryland election on Tuesday that will only have three places for in-person voting out of concern for the coronavirus, as election officials are strongly urging eligible voters to mail in their ballots in a single race to decide who will serve the rest of the term of the late  U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, who died in October.    In hopes of avoiding the lines seen in this month's Wisconsin primary, roughly 484,000 ballots were mailed to registered voters in the district. More than 77,000 already have been turned in. More than half of the vote could be released on the state elections board website shortly after the 8 p.m. poll close on Tuesday.  Precautions due to the virus in this special election have thrust the candidates into unknown campaign territory in the time of a pandemic.  Fundraising has been tough. Candidates haven't been able to reach voters with traditional techniques like door-to-door campaigning or large events. Both candidates say they have been trying to reach voters more through social media.

A search feature allows Texans to locate test collection sites near them and includes important details such as contact information and hours of operation for each location,  CBS DFW reports.  \"This mapping tool will help Texans locate test collection sites in their communities and it is part of our commitment to expanding COVID-19 testing throughout Texas,\" said Texas Governor Greg Abbott. \"By using this map, Texans will have access to pertinent information on a variety of test collection options that will help fulfill testing needs in communities across the Lone Star State.\"  More than 340 test collection sites are currently listed on the map and additional locations will be added as more sites are identified across the state.  Texans can submit updated information about a test collection site or suggest additional sites by filling out an online form. Officials will then verify the information and update the map accordingly.

Barrera said prolonged ventilator use can strain vocal folds, which affects communication, swallowing and breathing.  \"For individuals who have a respiratory disorder like COVID-19, and you add on the addition of prolonged ventilator use, we're seeing a new type of rehabilitation necessary to help them get back those essential functions,\" she said.  Typically speech pathologists and a team of specialists use a variety of exams to monitor a patient's vocal recovery, but like the rest of the health care system right now, they're strained for resources.  \"The taxing part on the speech pathologists right now is we're somewhat limited in some of the tools that we typically use,\" said Dr. Luis Riquelme, a speech pathologist in a Brooklyn hospital.   He said to keep up with the effects of COVID-19 and the influx of patients on ventilators, his colleagues have to rely on clinical exams versus more precise testing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-be9aba52                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       10:01 AM / April 25, 2020              Pandemic could affect Florida's hurricane response                                                            Florida officials are considering adjusting the state's hurricane-response plans to prepare for the possibility of an early storm season coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic,  CBS Miami reports .  The state's Division of Emergency Management director, Jared Moskowitz, said they are considering using hotel rooms instead of school or mass shelters to allow people to continue social distancing. People there would be given masks and other protective gear, while also having their temperatures monitored.  The director said the state might want to talk about ride-share companies providing transportation to those facilities to avoid the problems that buses or shuttles could create.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-fd722c1a                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       9:52 AM / April 25, 2020              Trump retweets CDC guidance on safe use of disinfectants                                                            President Trump retweeted a tweet by the CDC warning people about health problems associated with improper use of disinfectants and household cleaners.  The president suggested  at his daily coronavirus briefing Thursday that health experts look into the possibility of using disinfectant for coronavirus patients, perhaps by injection.  \"And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute,\" the president said Thursday. \"One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning. Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that. So that, you're going to have to use medical doctors with. But it sounds — it sounds interesting to me.\" Mr. Trump later claimed he was being sarcastic. Hours earlier, the White House press secretary had given a different explanation for the remarks, saying they were taken out of context.  \"I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen,\" the president told CBS News' Weijia Jiang in the Oval Office. The idea of using disinfectant products in that way was met with quick rebuke from the medical community.  In a statement on its website,  RB, the makers of Lysol and Dettol , said: \"As a global leader in health and hygiene products, we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route).

The relaxation did not apply to hundreds of quarantined towns and other hotspots that have been hit hardest by the outbreak that has killed at least 775 people in India and terrified its multitudes of poor who live in slum conditions too crowded for social distancing. Shopping malls also remained closed across the country.  Last week, India also allowed manufacturing and farming activities to resume in rural areas. The country's stay-home restrictions have allowed people out of their homes only to buy food, medicine or other essentials.  The global death toll climbed Saturday toward 200,000, according to a tally compiled by John Hopkins University. In Europe, Belgium sketched out plans for a progressive lockdown relaxation, starting May 4 with the resumption of nonessential treatment in hospitals and the reopening of textile and sewing shops so people can make face masks. Bars and restaurants would be allowed to start reopening June 8, although Belgian Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes cautioned that a surge in infections could alter the timeline. In France, the government is preparing to gingerly ease one of Europe's strictest lockdowns from May 11.  Denmark has reopened schools for the youngest grades.

He said officials there found a way for low-risk construction to resume. But he said,\" the day of opening our whole economy certainly is not today.\" \"It would be way too dangerous,\" he said. \"And all of our data shows that if we did this today, this virus would return with a vengeance.\" An overwhelming majority of Americans agree, according to a variety of opinion polls.  Watch the full report:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-6c223c1c                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       8:15 AM / April 25, 2020              Doctors experiment with unproven stem cell therapy on COVID-19 patients                                                            Doctors are hoping stem cell therapy could be a weapon in the fight against  coronavirus .

San Francisco has seen at least 1,340 positive cases of COVID-19 and 22 people have died due to the coronavirus.  The San Francisco Police Department commended the public for not celebrating 4/20 outdoors on Monday and in public parks as is tradition, but still said there are people and business who continue to flout the stay-at-home order.

Judge Dolly Gee of the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles found that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which detains migrant families with children, and the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which has custody over unaccompanied minors, are both violating the Flores Settlement Agreement during the coronavirus pandemic, for distinct reasons. Over the years and throughout different administrations, Gee has found that the government has violated elements of the settlement, primarily its requirement that migrant children be released from custody without \"unnecessary delay.\" But Friday's order considered the risks faced by immigrants detained in close quarters during a deadly, global pandemic. In a different order last month, Gee called immigration detention centers \"hotbeds of contagion.\" The order applies to the approximately 2,100 unaccompanied minors in ORR custody, as well as the 342 children held with their families at the three ICE family detention centers.  Through Friday's order, Gee required both ICE and the U.S. refugee agency to \"make every effort to promptly and safely\" release the children in their custody who have sponsors, don't pose a danger to themselves or others and are not flight risks. She prohibited the agencies from using certain justifications to continue detaining minors.  Read more here.

Some of the most difficult to hear are those which involve children. And Dr. Anna Zimmermann, a neonatologist in Denver, Colorado, just added her son's story to that list. \"Since March 12th, the kids have not left the house,\" she wrote in a blog post on her website, Mighty Littles. \"My husband went to Costco once. I went to Target once. My kids never went on a playdate. I wouldn't let them go across the street to talk to their neighborhood friends. We adopted the stay-at-home recommendations early and stuck to them. We did everything right. But Lincoln got sick.\" Zimmerman said her son, Lincoln, is four years old.

That same night, he progressed up to needing 4L.

As a doctor, I knew he was working hard to breathe. The medical terms used to describe respiratory distress - seesaw breathing, nasal flaring, grunting, retracting, tachypneic - he had them all.

The Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program, recently expanded to cover businesses affected by the  coronavirus , offers qualified firms emergency cash advances of up to $10,000 on low-interest loans worth up to $2 million that are repayable over 30 years.  It sounds promising, but small business owners who have applied for the loans through the U.S. Small Business Administration describe the process as confusing and complain that the money is slow to materialize.   \"We put in our EIDL application right away. First we were told it was for $10,000. About a month later, on April 23, we found money in our account, but it wasn't anything close to what we thought we were getting,\" said K.B. Brown, owner of Wolfpack Promotionals, a print shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Weeks after he applied, Brown said he received a $3,000 advance on the loan, which isn't enough to cover even one month of business expenses. He doesn't know if he'll be approved for a larger disaster loan, noting that he hasn't received any follow-up information from the SBA.  \"Right now, we need at least $25,000 on the low end to get caught up, make sure our vendors are paid, and bring people back,\" Brown said.  Read more here.                                                                              By Megan Cerullo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-update-covid-19-2020-04-25/#post-update-4a1b2730                                                                                   link copied                                                                                       7:55 AM / April 25, 2020              Coronavirus is spreading fast in states that may reopen soon, study finds                                                            The COVID-19 coronavirus has saturated the United States, and it appears to be spreading quickly in some places that are planning to ease social distancing restrictions soon, a new study shows. County-level data shows COVID-19 cases in all 306 \"hospital referral regions\" in the United States, the areas where people go for hospital or specialist care, said study leader Dr. Elliott Fisher, a professor of health policy and medicine at The Dartmouth Institute in Lebanon, N.H. \"We need to be aware that this epidemic is far from over. The number of cases in every region today are higher than they were a week ago,\" said Fisher. \"We have no place in the country where there are not cases being reported within a region.\" The data also show that COVID-19 cases are growing more rapidly in places that have not been as heavily hit as New York City, Seattle, San Francisco and other early coronavirus hot spots. \"The growth rates that are highest are now in the Midwest and in the South,\" Fisher said.

One takeaway from the report is that states still lack the resources they need to reopen. While the 38-page, 10-point roadmap relies on some of the White House and federal guidelines, the NGA's roadmap goes into much greater practical detail, focusing on the public health aspect of the pandemic more than specific business reopenings. The report observes that testing capacity in the U.S. remains \"inadequate\" to move forward, despite repeated assurances from the White House that the U.S. has enough testing for states that meet other criteria to begin to reopen. The NGA is led by Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a vocal Republican in a blue state. President Trump derided Hogan in a White House press briefing earlier this week, after Hogan and his wife secured 500,000 tests from South Korea, when Hogan deemed the number the state could acquire through the federal government and U.S. companies insufficient. Mr. Trump has often said the federal government will help states while emphasizing he believes it's the governors' responsibility to secure testing and other necessary equipment on their own. The report comes as some states, like Georgia, plan to reopen businesses soon. President Trump publicly expressed his disagreement with Georgia Governor Brian Kemp over his decision to reopen businesses like hair salons, tattoo parlors and bowling allies on Friday. \"With the paramount aim of keeping individuals and communities safe, governors are committed to reopening states in a manner that preserves public safety and confidence,\" the NGA report says. \"Opening prematurely â or opening without the tools in place to rapidly identify and stop the spread of the virus â could send states back into crisis mode, push health systems past capacity, and force states back into strict social distancing measures. This scenario would repeat the negative economic consequences of pandemic response and reduce public confidence, further deepening a recession and protracting economic recovery.\" To expand testing capacity, governors should consider \"continuing to request that the federal government rapidly build testing capacity and coordinate distribution to states,\" among other things. Just how many tests will be needed is still up for debate, the NGA notes. Estimates range from 750,000 to tens of millions per week. The report also notes a \"shortage\" of critical supplies, \"insufficient\" personal protective equipment for health care workers, and a \"maldistribution\" of supplies \"owing to an uncoordinated supply chain.\"It details how states can use antibody testing and contact tracing to determine who could be immune to the virus, and where positive cases might have spread it. The report points out that many more contact tracers will be needed â Johns Hopkins estimates there should be between 4 and 81 tracers per 100,000 people, depending on how widespread the virus is in a given community. Additional funding, the report highlights, will be needed for \"wrap-around support services for individuals who may require assistance to comply with isolation and quarantine, such as health, housing and nutrition services.\"States are already voicing concerns about budget shortfalls, saying they need more funding from the federal government. The report also instructs states on how to assess hospital capacity, and to prepare for any infection surges. States should determine how best to protect vulnerable populations, including minorities, homeless populations and inmate populations, the report says. An advisory on racial disparities of COVID-19 should also be established, it says. Strategies for reducing crowded facilities includes early release for inmates who are medically compromised or are incarcerated for low-level, non-violent offenses, according to the NGA. The NGA also acknowledged a question the Coronavirus Task Force has been unable to answer so far â what can be done to prevent people in one \"hot spot\" state from traveling to a low-risk state.\"Governors and state health officials will need to develop a plan for addressing interstate travel and tourism, including travel to and from one state to another state that may have high incidence of COVID-19.\" But the report also details how states should approach reopening the economy as well. States should consider or require public and private employers to report the number of COVID-19 cases, or workers in isolation or quarantine. Businesses should utilize engineering controls, like hands-free technology and barriers between workers, the report says. \"The challenges posed by COVID-19 will continue to evolve, and will require governors to continually assess and adjust plans as they develop data-informed responses that suit their own unique circumstances, challenges and the needs of their communities,\" the report concludes. ", "section": "Politics", "bylines": ["Kathryn Watson"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "The plan is far more detailed than the one the White House released and emphasizes the need for things like increased testing capacity.", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.12365923384791307, "subjectivity": 0.40522870211549455, "wordcount": 773}

The fallout has left roughly 1 in 6 workers without a job, a number that dwarfs the Great Recession's impact on the U.S. labor market. The number of people filing for unemployment for the week of April 18 reflects a decline of 810,000 from the previous week, the Department of Labor said Thursday. Unemployment claims, reported weekly, are a barometer of the job market because they indicate how many workers have lost their jobs. Many economists say the nation's unemployment rate is around 15% and could eventually approach 20%. The jobless rate peaked at about 25% during the Great Depression.\"This is another terrible week for layoffs,\" said Aberdeen Standard Investments senior global economist James McCann in an email. \"One of the concerns is that the government support doesn't seem to be stemming the tide here.\"The Paycheck Protection Program, designed to help small businesses maintain their payrolls, has faced criticism for failing to help many of the companies it was designed to aid. The program sent billions to areas of the country with relatively few novel coronavirus cases as well as to larger companies, including national restaurant chains. Lawmakers are now working on another relief package that would replenish funds for the program, which was quickly depleted. But it's unclear whether that funding will reach small businesses quickly enough to save jobs, noted Jeff Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments.\"Small businesses have faced challenges with the Paycheck Protection Program, which ran out of funding last week,\" he noted in an email. \"Most small businesses have only a month of cash on hand and shutdowns have now extended past that point in much of the country.\"\"In the millions\"Jobless claims will likely gradually decline in the coming weeks, although they \"are still set to remain on levels in the millions,\" Morgan Stanley economist Jan Kozak said in a report ahead of the latest labor data.A jobless rate of 15% in April would reflect a spike of more than 10 percentage points within a month, given that the March jobless rate stood at 4.4%. It would also exceed the Great Recession's highest unemployment rate, which reached 10% in October 2009. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will report the monthly unemployment rate in early May. \"We cannot be sure of the magnitude of job losses in April, but are certain they will be shockingly high,\" Rubeela Farooqi of High Frequency Economics said in a report. \"Labor market conditions have deteriorated sharply in response to the economy largely being closed for virus containment.\"", "section": "MoneyWatch", "bylines": ["Aimee Picchi"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "About 4.4 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week as the fallout from the pandemic continued.", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.12410866910866912, "subjectivity": 0.470997150997151, "wordcount": 447}

First we were told it was for $10,000. About a month later, on April 23, we found money in our account, but it wasn't anything close to what we thought we were getting,\" said K.B. Brown, owner of Wolfpack Promotionals, a print shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Weeks after he applied, Brown said he received a $3,000 advance on the loan, which isn't enough to cover even one month of business expenses. He doesn't know if he'll be approved for a larger disaster loan, noting that he hasn't received any follow-up information from the SBA. \"Right now, we need at least $25,000 on the low end to get caught up, make sure our vendors are paid, and bring people back,\" Brown said. The EIDL program was designed to provide businesses with a loan advance within three days of a successful application, according to the SBA's website. Almost all the businesses that applied for EIDL funds requested the emergency grant, which is designed to help cover them while they wait for their full loans to be processed, according to a survey from the National Federation of Independent Business. The SBA has said it has processed more than 755,000 loan advances, totaling more than $3.2 billion, and has approved nearly 27,000 loans worth more than $5.5 billion combined.But business owners from across the country told CBS MoneyWatch the program has fallen short of their expectations. And according to the NFIB survey, \"most applicants of the EIDL have yet to receive an update on the statuses of their application and no small business applicants have [reported to the NFIB they] received the loan or the emergency grant.\" About three-quarters of those surveyed by the NFIB described frustration with the process of applying as well as what they agreed was the SBA's lack of communication. Bryan Davis, founder of Teddy Stratford, a direct-to-consumer men's shirt company, was also counting on immediate assistance through the EIDL program after his sales slumped as Americans cut their spending. \"Business went from totally fine to literally less than nothing,\" Davis said. \"I thought, this $10,000 is going to keep the wolves away.\" Instead, Davis is still waiting to hear back on his application roughly three weeks after applying for EIDL money. \"The weird thing is, I haven't heard anything at all. I'm wondering, did I not fill it out properly, was there another step I needed to take that I didn't know about, or is it caught in limbo?\"Where did my loan go?Other business owners said they were initially made offers for five-figure loans that allowed them see a path forward for their businesses â only for these lifelines to mysteriously vanish after they tried to accept them. Denise Brown, a controller for Molly Moon's Homemade Ice Cream, a Seattle, Washington-based chain of ice cream shops, told CBS MoneyWatch her company was offered a $500,000 loan through the EIDL program.\"It was really something that would get us through, and we felt like we had gotten some salvation,\" she said of the loan. The relief was short-lived. \"We stated making a plan to re-open the business only to find, the next day, that the status of the loan was 'declined.' After we had been approved, there was a zero dollar loan amount, and the SBA help-line said they couldn't provide us with any additional information.\"Brown is still waiting for an explanation of why the initial relief offer was suddenly withdrawn. \"The entire company went on this ride where we had a plan, only to have the rug pulled out from under us,\" Brown said. \"It's so hard when there is already so much uncertainty about what the future will look like, for there to also be this kind of uncertainty about what help we can expect from the government.\" Molly Moon's Homemade Ice Cream isn't the only small business whose loan seems to have suddenly disappeared.Andrew Volk, who with his wife Briana co-owns the Portland Hunt and Alpine Club, a bar and restaurant in Portland, Maine, received an EIDL offer on April 14, about a month after he applied to the program.\"We logged into the portal, which said we were approved for a loan that would have allowed us to reopen,\" Volk said. \"There was a moment where Briana and I looked at each other and said this could be the solution for us right here. This could work. That was a great feeling,\" he said. Again, that flush of excitement didn't last long. Volk accepted the loan, only to be notified that the offer had been declined. \"We got a message basically saying, 'We can no longer process your application at this time. You'll receive an email with further details.'\"A week later, he still hasn't received clarification from the SBA, whose customer service agents he described as \"very friendly, but clearly new to the job.\"Volk now feels as if he's back to square one. \"I am now in a holding pattern. There was this movement, and now the SBA has run out of money for EIDLs. I was declined, and there is absolutely nobody who can explain why,\" he said. Officials with the SBA did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's requests for comment about the EIDL program and the business owners' complaints about their experiences. Brown, who owns the print shop, said the shortage of federal aid means he faces tough decisions ahead. His wife has applied for a job at Amazon, and he's considering selling some of his printing equipment.

Khara Jabola-Carolus, the executive director of the commission, told CBS News in a phone interview that since Buzzfeed News first reported on the problem last week, her office has been fielding calls from women around the country, from San Francisco to Indianapolis, asking her office â far from the mainland â for help.  \"Women didn't seem to have any clue about where to go,\"  Jabola-Carolus said.As part of the growing list of COVID-19-related priorities for the department, Barr has enlisted the help of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Eric Dreiband, and Christina Nolan, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Vermont, to spearhead the effort.At the beginning of April, about a third of renters in the U.S. failed to make their payments on time, according to the National Multifamily Housing Council. Last week, 4.4 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits, and more than 26 million Americans have lost their jobs because of the pandemic.But while some landlords have provided rent relief for their tenants who may be feeling financial strain given growing financial uncertainty, others are violating state and federal housing laws by demanding sexual favors in lieu of a monthly payment.Predatory practices in housing have been an ongoing problem that the department has been monitoring since the creation of its Sexual Harassment and Housing initiative in 2017. Earlier this month, the Department announced that it had filed a lawsuit against the co-owners and managers of several rental properties in Russellville, Kentucky, who had allegedly engaged in persistent harassment against female tenants since 2012.  The defendants violated the Fair Housing Act when they persisted in the conduct, the Justice Department says. In one example, a property manager was \"offering to grant tangible housing benefits â such as reducing the rent and overlooking or excusing late or unpaid rent â to female tenants in exchange for sexual favors.\"No attorneys of record could be found for the defendants in that case.\"The current times are difficult enough without predatory practices by unscrupulous landlords,\" Barr said.Read the Justice Department memo here:", "section": "Politics", "bylines": ["Clare Hymes"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "\"This behavior is not tolerated in normal times, and certainly will not be tolerated now,\" Attorney General William Barr said.", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.09159663865546219, "subjectivity": 0.4550420168067226, "wordcount": 475}

Five years later, he launched One Community, which co-finances media projects focused on social impact campaigns. Its first project, \"Just Mercy,\" was released earlier this year.Budnick said he took an interest in criminal justice after volunteering inside a juvenile hall in 2004. \"I said to those kids that [first] day, 'if you're willing to transform your lives, I'm by your side the whole time.' And I just jumped in full-fledged,\" he added.Budnik said ARC has helped 1,600 formerly incarcerated men and women. He said the recidivism rate for members of his organization is under 10%. The national average hovers closer to 68%, according to a study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\"When I left the film business and started a nonprofit and took a huge pay cut, it was the best five years of my life,\" he said. \"Because I have people on the couch sitting in the waiting room of ARC every day who are just so passionate to change their lives.\"Budnick said in the 15 years he's volunteered inside prisons, he's consistently seen illness, like the flu, \"spread like wildfire,\" and said more needs to be done to mobilize early releases during the coronavirus pandemic.\"I believe in redemption and the power of transformation for a lot of people that have done some serious things,\" Budnick said. \"I don't think this should be a death sentence for anybody. We need to do smart things to reduce the prison population in a way that doesn't compromise public safety.\"Budnick said he frequently receives calls from inmates he has known for years through volunteering. \"They are terrified not just for themselves, but really for their families, for their friends and for their communities,\" he said.To address concerns of people inside, Budnick is creating a series of video content to distribute to corrections facilities. His first collaboration aired inside California prisons earlier this month. The rapper Common held a Zoom meeting with former inmates focused on mental health and safety during the pandemic.\"We were able to take that conversation and send it to the California Department of Corrections,\" Budnick said of the initiative. \"They put it on every TV and in every cell so we could give those in prison the same type of hope, optimism and inspiration. As soon as we did that, about a dozen other states reached out to show it in their prisons to bring the same amount of hope and optimism.\" Budnick has shown \"Just Mercy\" to governors across the country in hopes of inspiring dialogue around criminal justice reform. \"I really realized that when I told stories, or people heard stories, about human beings that really beat the odds and changed their lives, their perspectives changed,\" Budnick added. \"I realized that in the film and television business, we have an enormous platform to do a lot of harm in terms of the stories that we tell or do a lot of good.\"", "section": "Entertainment", "bylines": ["Tyler Kendall"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "Film producer Scott Budnick, who took a break from the industry to focus on criminal justice reform, sat down with CBS News for an interview on leaving Hollywood.", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.10071766295170553, "subjectivity": 0.396420128335022, "wordcount": 562}

He made the announcement during his daily White House coronavirus briefing Wednesday.\"Operation America Strong was the idea of our great military men and women,\" Mr. Trump said. \"The Thunderbirds and the Blue Angels crews who wanted to show support to the American medical workers, who just like military members in a time of war are fiercely running forward the fight.\" \"It's gonna be great. I want to see those shows. I've seen them many times and I can't get enough of them,\" he added.The Washington Post first reported that flyovers were being planned for New York, Washington, Baltimore, Newark, Trenton, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Houston, Austin and Dallas. CBS News national security correspondent David Martin confirmed the joint flyovers would occur in some 30 cities, including the ones mentioned in the Post report. The tributes would be conducted soon after the Pentagon receives approval from the White House, Martin reported. Each squadron would cost at least $60,000 per hour to fly, according to the Post. But the total could run higher since the Pentagon tells CBS News the cost per flying hour for an F-16 is approximately $20,000. A Department of Defense official told CBS News that there would be no additional cost to taxpayers since flyovers are already included in the teams' annual operational budgets.Mr. Trump also said he aims to move forward with plans for the annual July Fourth celebration on the National Mall in Washington, but with a smaller crowd to help protect spectators. \"Last year was a tremendous success and I would imagine we'll do it,\" he said. \"Hopefully I can use the term forever as a great success.\"Over the weekend, following the Air Force Academy's graduation, the Thunderbirds flew over parts of Colorado as a sign of gratitude to health care workers, first responders and other essential personnel in the state. University of Colorado Hospital UCHealth nurse Kim Clark told CBS Denver that she appreciated the gesture. \"It does mean a lot, and it makes you realize that people do really care and see what we're doing even though they're not able to come in the hospital,\" she said.", "section": "U.S.", "bylines": ["Christopher Brito"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "The military flyovers would occur in some 30 cities, including New York, Washington, Atlanta and Dallas.", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.13960892710892708, "subjectivity": 0.3678030303030303, "wordcount": 388}

The Army was forced to suspend taking in new recruits until it overhauled basic training, major exercises were cancelled and a front-line aircraft carrier was sidelined. The Pentagon had plans for combating a pandemic, but General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, the commander of the military response to coronavirus, told 60 Minutes, \"This plan did not survive contact with the enemy.\"  David Martin brought 60 Minutes cameras to witness the military's war on coronavirus for a story to be broadcast Sunday, April 26 at 7 p.m. ET/PT on CBS. Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General John Hyten is the military's number-two in command. He confers with the Pentagon's Crisis Management Team daily. \"We have to figure out how to operate and fight through a world where coronavirus exists,\" he told Martin. \"If we just wait for what, you know, everybody hopes is going to happen, which is the disease goes away, and it doesn't, and we haven't planned for the other case, we're in a bad situation.\" Martin went to basic army training at Fort Jackson in South Carolina, where last month, 64 recruits among 940 tested positive for COVID-19. He saw face-masked soldiers struggling to stay apart. \"Day to day our biggest problem is keeping them in that six feet,\" Lt. Col. Patrick Collins said. \"You tend to tell them, 'OK, separate. Get your six feet.' Couple minutes later, they start clustering again.\" For two weeks, the Army had to stop taking in new recruits because of the virus. \"I'm not aware of any time, at least, you know, in my 39 years, where we stopped taking recruits. But these are different times,\" Army Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville said. \"The toughest decision that we had to make was to cancel Defender 20,\" McConville said. The Army was already sending the necessary tanks to Europe six weeks ago for Defender 20, one of the largest exercises since the Cold War. \"What would happen if we had 15,000 or 20,000 in a very close environment andâ¦ the virus broke out? How would we take care of them?\" Nearly 800 sailors aboard the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt  tested positive for the virus, but more than half of them had no symptoms. \"We had so many assumptions of what a virus would do,\" General Hyten told Martin, \"and then when you actually see what coronavirus does, what COVID-19 does, it's completely different.\" \"Having an enemy that you don't fully understand is always a little bit frustrating.\" General O'Shaughnessy said.", "section": "60 Minutes", "bylines": ["CBS News"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "The Pentagon's plans for combating a pandemic, \"did not survive contact with the enemy,\" according to the general in charge of the response. 60 Minutes reports, Sunday.", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.003209728867623615, "subjectivity": 0.398145933014354, "wordcount": 440}

They're also more likely than other groups to not be able to work from home, adding to the health risk.Chicago's Jose Gonzalez is a first-generation Mexican American, one of the nation's 60 million Latinos.\"My family has pushed me so far ahead that I can't just allow myself to sit there and do nothing,\" he told CBS News.He used to work two jobs, but lost one in the COVID-19 shutdown. Now his life-line is cooking at a hotel housing COVID patients.\"We don't have the benefit of 'I should just stay home' ... and I feel like that's every Latino at this point right now,\" Gonzalez said.Gonzalez is among the 84% of Latinos who can't work from home â the most of any group.Roughly half of Latino households have experienced job losses or cuts amid the pandemic and have $500 or less in savings.Organizer Leone Jose Bicchieri of Working Family Solidarity, said Latinos are more likely to be in low-wage â and now high-risk â essential jobs like the food industry.\"We're getting plenty of people calling us â not knowing what to do,\" Bicchieri said. \"They're crying. They're desperate.\"\"We're talking about food processors, grocery stores, bread making facilities, all kinds of cleaning companies,\" Bicchieri explained. \"Many of them, again, are balancing, 'on the one hand, I don't want the crisis of getting sick. On the other hand, I don't want the crisis of being homeless, because I can't pay rent. And I can't buy food.'\"The need is already great. In Chicago's Mexican neighborhood of Pilsen, a socially-distant line wraps around the block outside Pilsen Food Pantry.Dr. Evelyn Figueroa, a family physician who opened the pantry two years ago, said demand is up 45%.\"This tells us that people are really on the fringe. When we talk about the 50% of people living paycheck to paycheck, they are standing [here] right now,\" Figueroa said. \"These are people that cannot afford to have the kids home from school and feed them.\"Figueroa, who also treats COVID patients at a local homeless shelter, said Latinos â like African Americans â have underlying health issues that impact their coronavirus outcomes.\"Latinos actually have a higher rate of diabetes than any other ethnic group in the United States. About 16% are diabetic. It's a significant problem. It's also a risk factor for complications of COVID,\" she said. At her food pantry, most of the people in line are Latino, including undocumented immigrants who do not qualify for unemployment or the federal stimulus. People like Rosa, who's undocumented and has lived in the U.S. for 20 years. She said she's desperate. She has two kids and is two months behind on rent. Her debts now totals $2,000.She told CBS News in Spanish that she's unable to sleep because of the stress. She's taking it one day at a time because she knows tomorrow isn't promised.Bicchieri, the labor organizer, said regardless of where people stand on the issue of immigration, undocumented immigrants need protections in this pandemic.\"Let's put the ideological discussion down for a couple months. Let's come back to it. It's really important,\" he said. \"Right now, I want to be safe. I want my family to be safe. So I want Eva to be safe. I want Anna to be safe. I want Maria and Jose to be safe because then I'm safer.\"\"You're not going to make anyone safer by having any portion of the population â let alone anywhere between 6 and 12 million undocumented people â get sick. Because then you're going to get sick. Your grandma will get sick,\" Bicchieri said.", "section": "CBS Evening News", "bylines": ["Adriana Diaz"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "\"We don't have the benefit of 'I should just stay home,'\" a first-generation Mexican American tells CBS News of the need to make money during the pandemic.", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.0752222222222222, "subjectivity": 0.4856587301587302, "wordcount": 636}

We will continue with this approach to protect the lives â and livelihoods â of all Georgians,\" Kemp posted on Twitter.The governor praised Mr. Trump for his \"bold leadership and insight during these difficult times.\"Earlier this week, Kemp issued new guidance to give shuttered businesses the option of reopening. On Friday, Georgia will allow gyms, bowling alleys, tattoo parlors, barbers, hair and nail salons and massage therapists to begin operating again if they fulfill health and safety requirements. On Monday, the state will allow theaters and restaurant dine-in services to reopen if they follow social distancing and sanitation guidelines.Kemp is also allowing elective medical procedures to resume.Georgia is the first state to begin lifting restrictions on businesses, though governors of Tennessee and South Carolina also announced this week they will permit some businesses to reopen. The move comes after the White House issued new guidelines for governors as they look to revive their economies. Still, leaders of several states have extended stay at-home-orders into May as the death toll from the coronavirus in the U.S. approaches 50,000.Mr. Trump said Wednesday he told Kemp he disagrees with his decision to reopen certain businesses and said the state has not fulfilled the criteria outlined by his administration to proceed to a phased opening. \"I want him to do what he thinks is right, but I disagree with him on what he's doing,\" the president told reporters. \"But I think spas and beauty salons and tattoo parlors and barbershops in phase one â we're going to have phase two very soon â is just too soon. I think it's too soon.\"Mr. Trump said he believes those businesses \"can wait a little bit longer.\"\"Safety has to predominate. We have to have that,\" he said. Georgia GOP Congressman Doug Collins, who is running for the Senate, criticized Kemp for what he said is a lack of communication surrounding his plans to lift restrictions, and said local officials should have had more input.\"The president wants the country open. I want the country open. The governor wants the country open,\" Collins said in an interview with \"Fox and Friends.\" \"The problem is, how do you do it? And I think that's the problem with leadership. Leadership is about communicating, and when you are not communicating clearly â look, the governor did not take away the stay-at-home order, but yet selectively decided certain businesses are going to open up.\"Georgia GOP Senator Kelly Loeffler backs the governor's decision while Republican Senator David Perdue favors a nuanced approach.\"The governor has been very thoughtful in undertaking this decision,\" Loeffler, Collins' opponent in the Senate primary, told CBS affiliate WTOC-TV. \"He's being guided by leading health officials. This is very gradual and data-driven.\"Perdue said he applauds Kemp's efforts to gradually reopen the state.\"He's trying to phase in in a measured way reopening the economy in Georgia, and there's a human cost to closing down businesses just like there's a human cost to the disease, to the virus,\" he told WTOC.", "section": "Politics", "bylines": ["Melissa Quinn"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "Governor Brian Kemp said the decision to allow some businesses to reopen is \"driven by data and guided by state public health officials.\"", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.0815892599464028, "subjectivity": 0.34337765409193977, "wordcount": 598}

A loophole in the bill allowed large chains â including Ruth's Hospitality Group, which operates more than 100 steakhouses across the U.S. â to apply for loans for each of its subsidiaries, despite having more than 5,000 employees and $468 million in revenue last year. Ruth's Chris joins other restaurant companies, including Shake Shack and Sweetgreen, in returning its multimillion dollar loan after facing backlash from the small business community. More than 260,000 people signed a Change.org petition demanding that the pricey steak joint return the loans earmarked for small businesses. \"In an effort to protect our team members and their loved ones, Ruth's Hospitality Group applied for and received loans under the federal government's Paycheck Protection Program. We were eligible for this assistance, and our goal was to utilize funds to keep as many of our team members working for as long as possible, cover 100% of health care benefits and position Ruth's Chris to rebuild its workforce as quickly as possible,\" the company said in a statement to CBS News. \"We intended to repay this loan in adherence with government guidelines. As we learned more about the funding limitations of the program and the unintended impact, we have decided to accelerate that repayment. We remain dedicated to protecting our hardworking team. It is our hope that these funds are loaned to another company to protect their employees, just as we intended,\" Ruth's Chris added.The Paycheck program ran out of money last week, but lawmakers are expected to inject an additional $310 billion to fund more small business loans. The Main Street Alliance, which advocates for small businesses, applauded the move, but called on the government to fix what it called \"design flaws\" in the program. \"While we are glad to see Ruth's Chris returning the funding, it is not up to individual businesses to make good on issues with the Paycheck Protection Program,\" said Sarah Crozier, a Main Street Alliance spokesperson. \"The design flaws that allowed publicly traded companies and large businesses to take advantage of the program in the first place show how much lobby muscle these businesses have,\" she added.CBS News' Kris Van Cleave contributed reporting.", "section": "MoneyWatch", "bylines": ["Megan Cerullo"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "Steak house chain says it is giving the money back because of the Paycheck program's \"funding limitations.\"", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.14698660714285716, "subjectivity": 0.44267113095238103, "wordcount": 419}

In a lengthy interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, the independent mayor's remarks drew criticism from other Nevada officials.On Wednesday, as some states began to plan on easing COVID-19 lockdowns, Goodman questioned the effectiveness of social distancing measures and said that Vegas could serve as a \"placebo\" of sorts.\"We offered to be a control group,\" she said. \"I offered to be a control group and I was told by our statistician you can't do that because people from all parts of southern Nevada come in to work in the city and I said, Oh, that's too bad because I know when you have a disease, you have a placebo that gets the water and the sugar and then you get those that actually get the shot.\"\"We would love to be that placebo side so you have something to measure against,\" she added.Despite her call to open Vegas hotels, restaurants and casinos, she had no plan to offer on how to do it safely and pinned the responsibility on businesses to come up with guidelines themselves.\"I am not a private owner,\" said Goodman, who doesn't have jurisdiction over the Las Vegas Strip. \"That's the competition in this country. The free enterprise and to be able to make sure that what you offer the public meets the needs of the public.  Right now, we're in a crisis health-wise. And so for a restaurant to be open or small boutique to be open, they better figure it out.\"\"That's their job,\" she added. \"That's not the mayor's job.\"Nevada's Democratic governor fired back on CNN. \"I will not allow the citizens of Nevada, our Nevadans, to be used as a control group, as a placebo, whatever she wants to call it,\" said Gov. Steve Sisolak, who closed the Strip in March.\"We want to welcome everybody back to Las Vegas,\" he added. \"We want to welcome them back to the lights on the Strip. But it's not today and it's not tomorrow.\"There have been 163 coronavirus deaths in Clark County, where Las Vegas is located, according to the city's data.Democratic Congresswoman Dina Titus represents the city of Las Vegas and criticized Goodman for offering up her \"constituents as though they're guinea pigs in some grand experiment.\"\"We can bring back the economy which is one the things she seems to think is a priority, but you can't bring back people's lives,\" Titus said on CNN.Late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, who grew up in Vegas, was also turned off by Goodman's comments.\"The @mayoroflasvegas Carolyn Goodman should resign before lunch arrives today.

But there is potentially good news for summer â research shows the virus' lifespan is shortened by sunlight, heat and humidity, one administration expert said during Thursday's Coronavirus Task Force briefing. The death toll from COVID-19 in the U.S. is likely to hit 50,000 in a couple of days, and there is no indication the pace of the nation's losses â in terms of both lives and the economy â is about to slow significantly.\"We're winning this and we're gonna win it,\" Mr. Trump said as he opened up the briefing. \"And we're gonna keep watching and we're gonna watch very closely for the invisible enemy.\"During the briefing, the president floated the idea that somehow, doctors might be able to apply light to sick coronavirus patients. Dr. Deborah Birx said she hadn't heard of such an idea. When a Washington Post reporter pressed the president on how they should be encouraged by the news that light and heat stunt the virus given the deaths in Florida, the president shot back. \"I'm the president and you're fake news,\" he said. Members of the House returned to Washington, D.C., from their home districts to pass the $484 billion emergency relief package that replenishes the quickly depleted Paycheck Protection Program, which provides loans to small businesses struggling because of the epidemic.  The measure, passed by the Senate on Tuesday, also boosts funding for hospitals and provides money for coronavirus testing. President Trump said he will sign the legislation â \"I'm signing it probably tonight,\" he told reporters.Administered by the Small Business Administration, the loan program aims to ensure businesses keep employees on the payroll and can also pay their own bills. Already, more than 26 million Americans have filed for unemployment. In the last week alone, 4.4 million Americans filed for first-time unemployment.Governors in nearly all 50 states have issued stay-at-home orders and mandated nonessential businesses to close as part of efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus.National Governors Association released detailed roadmap to recoverySome governors have started rolling out plans to ease restrictions. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp plans to allow nonessential businesses â hair salons, bowling allies and tattoo parlors â to reopen Friday. Mr. Trump said Wednesday that he disagrees with Kemp's plan, and reiterated that on Thursday.\"I wasn't happy with Brian Kemp.

The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee raised $46.7 million in March. It is the most any Democratic presidential candidate raised in a single month of the 2020 election cycle to date. According to the Biden campaign, 70% of his fundraising for March came in online. The average donation was $40 and the occupation listed most often was \"teacher.\" His Federal Election Commission monthly filing shows the former vice president finished March with more than $26 million cash on hand. Biden's record March fundraising mirrors the rapid turnaround of the former vice president's campaign last month. He had not won a primary until South Carolina's Democratic contest on February 29. After his landslide win prompted his remaining moderate opponents, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar to drop their bids and back him before Super Tuesday, on March 3, Biden swept a majority of the states. In February, Biden raised less than half of what he did in March â just $18 million. And in January, he raised less than $9 million. \"It was your support which has made us the presumptive nominee of our party,\" Biden said in a fundraising email to supporters Monday evening acknowledging the dramatic shift in the race. \"That is something no one was predicting just a little over a month ago.\" The cash haul comes as Biden has had to shift to virtual campaigning amid precautions taken to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. In his email to supporters, he also indicated it would have an impact on his fundraising numbers moving forward. \"I know that April may not match March in fundraising, and that's okay by me. The world has changed a great deal. It's unrecognizable at times. Your family and your community need your generosity and strength now more than ever,\" the email read. While Biden continues to hold virtual fundraisers and make online appeals to supporters, his campaign faces a serious cash disadvantage compared to President Trump ahead of the general election. Last week, the Trump campaign announced that along with the Republican National Committee and joint fundraising committees, it raised $212 million in the first three months of 2020, including more than $63 million in March alone. The Republican operation had more than $240 million cash on hand at the end of March. According to its March FEC filing, the Democratic National Committee raised more than $32 million in March. $18 million of that came from a transfer from Mike Bloomberg's campaign after he dropped out of the race following Super Tuesday. The DNC finished the month with more than $35 million cash on hand, but is more than $5 million in debt.", "section": "Politics", "bylines": ["Sarah Ewall-Wice"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "He had his best fundraising month to date in March, as the Democratic field winnowed.", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.20641156462585036, "subjectivity": 0.3980272108843537, "wordcount": 467}

She loved to be sung to, enjoyed watching bright colors, hearing mommy and daddy's voice, being kissed and hugged and most of all being rocked to sleep. She despised tummy time, but found comfort in her rattle,\" La Santa wrote. \"We call her the Warrior Princess because she fought Covid-19 like nobody's business!!!! Her fight inspired all of the nurses, doctors and staff members that knew her,\" La Santa continued. \"Her purpose was served and she was called home on 4/20/2020.  We thought we were having a baby, but had an angel instead.\"The GoFundMe was set up to help the family with hospital bills after Jay-Natalie's long-term stay. Jerel La Santa posted a photo from his daughter's hospitalization on April 5. The photo shows him and his wife at their daughter's bedside, with balloons brightening the hospital room. His Facebook page is now flooded with condolences for the loss of Jay-Natalie.the family is extending an invitation to all for Jay-Natalie's funeral, according to the GoFundMe. There will be a Facebook livestream of the service, which will be held on May 2. CBS News has not independently confirmed Jay-Natalie died from COVID-19 and has reached out to the FDNY Hispanic Society and the La Santa family for more details. While it is uncommon for children and babies to die from the disease, they are not immune. Earlier this month, a 6-week-old baby who tested positive for the coronavirus died in Connecticut, Governor Ned Lamont confirmed.\"At present, the disease seems to be much milder in babies and children,\" writes Aaron Milstone, an associate hospital epidemiologist and pediatrician Johns Hopkins Hospital. \"That said, there is currently no vaccine, so parents should do everything they can to protect children from getting it.\"", "section": "Health", "bylines": ["Caitlin O'Kane"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "Her father, Jerel, called her \"Warrior Princess,\" for her fighting spirit against the horrible COVID-19 virus.", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.2338068181818182, "subjectivity": 0.6599999999999999, "wordcount": 436}

President Trump is now expected to sign the legislation, which lawmakers approved by a vote of 388-5.The legislation, known as the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, is the result of weeks of negotiations between congressional Democrats and the White House. The measure includes $75 billion for hospitals, $25 billion to establish a national testing regime, $60 billion in disaster aid and $310 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which provides loans to small businesses to help them retain workers and meet payroll. The PPP exhausted its initial $349 billion in funding last week.The vote comes as new government data shows 4.4 million people filed initial unemployment claims last week, raising the total number of people who have lost their jobs during the pandemic to about 26 million.Roughly $60 billion in new funds going to the PPP will be specifically targeted to financial institutions serving rural, unbanked and minority-owned businesses, a key priority for Democrats. Minority-owned businesses have been particularly affected by the pandemic, which has exacerbated preexisting structural issues that make it difficult for minority business owners to gain access to capital.The vote comes as the House tries to figure out how to continue its work without endangering its members. House Democrats unveiled a resolution Wednesday allows members to vote by proxy, meaning that one member could vote on behalf of a colleague who is not present. But Republicans objected to the proposed rule change, arguing that the House needs to formally get back to work.After discussions between Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Democrats agreed to postpone a vote on a rule change for now, and the House instead voted to establish a bipartisan Select Committee on the Coronavirus Crisis to oversee billions of dollars in spending under multiple relief bills.The House and Senate are not expected to formally reconvene until May. Democrats argue that lawmakers need to immediately begin working on another phase of relief legislation which would give more assistance to state and local governments, but Republicans have questioned whether it is necessary to begin working on new legislation so quickly.", "section": "Politics", "bylines": ["Grace Segers"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "The vote comes as new government data shows 4.4 million people​ filed initial unemployment claims last week.", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.00909090909090909, "subjectivity": 0.34573512906846243, "wordcount": 382}

In Los Angeles County, more than 15,000 people have tested positive for COVID-19, but health officials announced this week that antibody tests show the rate of infection could be 40 times that number. Serology tests were used in a study conducted earlier in April by the University of Southern California and the LA County Public Health Department. The tests, which detect antibodies in an individual's blood to determine if that person had the coronavirus, showed roughly 320,000 people, or about 4% of Los Angeles' population, have been infected with COVID-19, CBS Los Angeles reports.As of Tuesday night, there were 663 coronavirus deaths reported in Los Angeles. More than 45,000 people have died from the virus nationwide. Los Angeles Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer told reporters Monday that the serology tests provide \"a better understanding\" of how much of the city's populations has been infected with the virus, \"regardless of whether they were ever tested or they even had symptoms.\" \"So although I report that every day we have thousands of thousands of people who have tested positive, the serology testing lets us know that we have hundreds of thousands of people that have already developed antibodies to the virus,\" said Ferrer. \"Because at some point in time during the last couple of months, they have in fact been infected with COVID-19.\"According to CBS LA, the study was conducted between April 10 and April 14.While many health officials say the blood-based tests are key to re-opening the economy, others say the high demand for the tests has pushed the FDA to favor speed over accuracy, and that many tests on the market are not regulated. As a result, the accuracy of some serology tests has been put under significant scrutiny nationwide.    According to Reuters, a high number of false positives from antibody testing kits have been reported. In addition to skewing the data, this could lead some to believe they are immune to the disease when they are not. \"Even a very small false positive rate could lead to hundreds of thousands of people being told that they're safe when they might not be,\" Dr. Ania Wajnberg of Mt. Sinai in New York told \"CBS Evening News.\"Neeraj Sood, a professor of public policy at USC, and the lead researcher of the Los Angeles study, told Reuters that, by their estimates, \"We might have to recalibrate disease prediction models and rethink public health strategies.\"\"We haven't known the true extent of COVID-19 infections in our community,\" Sood said, \"because we have only tested people with symptoms and the availability of tests has been limited.\"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo also addressed antibody testing in his state Tuesday, stating that such testing would be useful to determine the true number of people were infected with COVID-19 and what the actual mortality rate is.", "section": "Health", "bylines": ["Li Cohen"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "A study using antibody tests showed roughly 320,000 people in Los Angeles County may have had COVID-19.", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.12925324675324673, "subjectivity": 0.42768458393458386, "wordcount": 482}

The mayor took to social media to share his Friday plans â a gym workout and a haircut â after Kemp's announcement that he was loosening restrictions on some businesses. The mayor, like Kemp a Republican, also posted in a no-longer publicly visible post first reported by the Atlanta Journal Constitution that he would soon be eating three meals a day at Marietta restaurants.Tumlin, the city's mayor since 2010, did not return a request for comment. A spokesperson said in an email that Marietta is following Kemp's reopening guidelines. As for Tumlin's end-of-week personal grooming appointment, the spokesperson stated: \"His plans may change, but at this point if he chooses to do so, according to the governor's order Mayor Tumlin can get a haircut on Friday.\"\"We're at the bottom of the totem pole\"Y'Kheyo Underwood, owner of Marietta's Good Look Barber Shop, is also on board with Kemp's decision, saying his shop will reopen Friday with the safety of its staff and customers in mind. In business 12 years, Underwood already had plenty of gloves on hand and stocked up on masks at a local beauty supply store. Each work station is equipped with Lysol wipes and hand sanitizer, he said.   \"I can remove every other waiting chair, if that amount of traffic comes in,\" he said of social-distancing mandates to keep people at least six feet apart. That said, he doesn't expect crowds â or even all of his four employees â to return right away. \"I don't think it'll be packed, the transition back to normalcy will take a little time. It shook people up,\" Underwood said of the pandemic.Underwood disagrees with critics of re-opening parts of the state's economy. \"Those complaining about reopening small businesses 'so soon' are either still getting paid by their companies or institutions while in the comfort of their own homes, or are retired,\" he said. \"I don't think anybody that has gone through what I have gone through in my line of work, trying to stay afloat, during these 'pandemic times', is complaining. We, as in small, 'non-essential' businesses, are at the bottom of the totem pole, so no one cares.\"He said he is among the many small businesses that applied for, but did not receive, low-interest loan relief from the government. Underwood paid half the rent on his shop at the start of the month, \"so I'm not digging myself too big a hole, and then after the shutdown I couldn't pay the second half.\"Like many other small businesses, Underwood has limited options. \"I had a few dollars in reserve that I've had to use,\" he explained, saying he didn't think he could pay the rent and keep a non-operating business going for more than a month and a half.\"We need to start making income, as soon as possible,\" he said. \"People are willing to take the risk of contracting the coronavirus just to pay the bills.\" Those sentiments were echoed by Marcia Sanders, a massage therapist who runs two therapeutic sites as a solo practitioner, one in Marietta, the other in nearby Hiram.\"When you have no money coming in, [re-opening] is a relief,\" Sanders said of Kemp's plan. Still, the lost income doesn't sit well with her, and Sanders believes the process could have been handled differently from the start. \"I just feel like we could have worn masks\" instead of shutting down, said Sanders, who disinfects her massage tables and face rests between customers. \"So I'm hoping I'm OK. I wear a mask, clients wear a mask. I have everybody wash their hands. It's a chance I take. I know people need me.\"Like Underwood, Sanders reports hitting a wall in applying for help from the U.S. Small Business Administration. \"My bank told me they ran out of money,\" said Sanders, in business 17 years. Another small business in Marietta isn't ready to reopen on Friday, according to a spokesperson for Barbearia Barber Shop.\"We are currently assessing our team's emotional and financial state, taking inventory and inquiring about availability to purchase products and items we will need in order to maintain our shop sanitized and safe for our team and clients,\" the Barbearia spokesperson said in an email. \"With that being said, we are not ready to set an opening date. It is financially straining to be closed for this long, but we are trying to be very conscious about the safety of our team and clients.\"", "section": "MoneyWatch", "bylines": ["Kate Gibson"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "Governor's controversial decision to let close-contact businesses open applauded by some struggling to stay afloat.", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.041826058201058204, "subjectivity": 0.36654100529100514, "wordcount": 944}

The latest emergency relief bill passed by the Senate after two weeks of negotiations â with the House voting Thursday â does not include new money for states.\"Not to fund state and local governments is incredibly short-sighted,\" Cuomo said at his daily press briefing on Thursday. \"They want to fund small business, fund the airlines. I understand that. But state and local government funds police and fire and teachers and schools. How do you not fund police and fire and teachers and schools in the midst of this crisis?\"\"Yes, airlines are important. Yes, small business is important,\" he added. \"So are police and fire and health care workers who are the frontline workers.  And when you don't fund the state, then the state can't fund those services.\"Cuomo said that while Republicans claim to be worried about the state of the economy, urging states to declare bankruptcy, which they cannot currently do, would damage the country's fiscal health.\"States should declare bankruptcy? That's how you're going to bring this national economy back?\" Cuomo said. \"You want to see that market fall through the cellar? Let New York state declare bankruptcy. Let Michigan declare bankruptcy. Let Illinois declare bankruptcy. Let California declare bankruptcy. You will see a collapse of this national economy.\"Cuomo was responding to comments McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, made to radio host Hugh Hewitt about Congress assisting state and local governments in future legislative packages.\"I think this whole business of additional assistance for state and local governments need to be thoroughly evaluated,\" McConnell said. \"You raised yourself the important issue of what states have done, many of them have done to themselves with their pension programs. There's not going to be any desire on the Republican side to bail out state pensions by borrowing money from future generations.\"The senator said he would \"certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route.\"Cuomo also took umbrage with a press release from McConnell's highlighting his remarks to Hewitt, which characterized federal assistance to states as \"blue state bailouts.\" Many of the states that have been hardest hit by the coronavirus are those run by Democratic governors.\"Vicious is saying what Senator McConnell said, this is a 'blue state bailout,'\" Cuomo said. \"What he's saying is if you look at the states that have coronavirus problems, they tend to be Democratic states. New York, California, Michigan, Illinois, they are Democratic states, so if you fund states that are suffering from the coronavirus, they're Democratic states. 'Don't help New York state because it is a Democratic state.' How ugly a thought.\"Cuomo said it is time to \"stop your political obsessive, political bias and anger.\"\"I mean, for crying out loud, if there was ever a time for you to put aside your pettiness and your partisanship and this political lens that you see the world through â Democrat and Republican, and we help Republicans but we don't help Democrats â that's not who we are,\" he said.Cuomo also took a jab at McConnell's home state of Kentucky, pointing out that New York contributes $116 billion to the federal budget, while Kentucky accepts $148 billion more from the federal government than it contributes.\"New York puts in more money to the federal pot than it takes out. His state takes out more than it puts in,\" he said. \"Senator McConnell, who's getting bailed out here? It's your state that is living on the money that we generate. Your state is getting bailed out, not my state.\"McConnell's remarks also drew the ire of New York Congressman Pete King, a Republican, who called them \"dismissive\" and said McConnell is the \"Marie Antoinette of the Senate.\"New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said the suggestion states should file for bankruptcy \"completely and utterly irresponsible.\"\"My breath is taken away. I have almost nothing to say to what I read that Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said earlier today,\" Murphy, a Democrat, said during his daily briefing Wednesday. \"Really? This is the time, in a moment of crisis unlike any our country has faced in at least 100 years, to suggest it's a good thing for states to go bankrupt?\"While McConnell has indicated his opposition to assisting state and local governments in additional emergency relief bills, he may not have the support of President Trump.Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Tuesday that after signing the latest package into law, \"we will begin discussions on the next Legislative Initiative with fiscal relief to State/Local Governments for lost revenues from COVID 19.\"", "section": "Politics", "bylines": ["Melissa Quinn"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "Cuomo said during his daily press briefing that not funding state and local governments is \"incredibly short-sighted.\"", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.07667836196062001, "subjectivity": 0.4139758762742633, "wordcount": 864}

He was moved to intensive care on April 15, and was not on a ventilator before he died.The senator wrote that she is \"grateful to the nurses and frontline staff who took care\" of her brother. \"But it's hard to know that there was no family to hold his hand or to say 'I love you' one more time â and no funeral for those of us who loved him to hold each other close.

And even more so than last month, many are bracing for a long period before social activities can resume.Fifty-four percent of Americans think daily life â the way people interact with each other and the way they work â will be permanently changed, while 46% think things will eventually return to normal.People living in communities that have been significantly impacted by the coronavirus are particularly likely to foresee a country forever changed: 62% of those who say their community has many cases of the coronavirus think life will be permanently changed after the virus is contained.Views of the future may be related to what people will do in the more near-term. Those who think things will eventually return to normal would be more comfortable going to public places if restrictions were lifted now, than would those who foresee permanent changes to day-to-day life after the outbreak.Assessments about how U.S. efforts against the virus are going now are related to one's outlook on life in the future. Most who think things are going well right now anticipate life returning to normal, while most  who say efforts are going badly think life in America will be permanently changed.There are differences by age, with younger people more likely than older people to think life will eventually return to normal. The percentage who expect day-to-day life to be permanently changed increases with age.Most people don't think the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. will be contained to the point that most activities can return any time soon. And the longer people say it will take to contain, the more they think there will be a lasting imprint on American life.Even more so than last month, we find many bracing for a long period before the outbreak is contained. Thirty-seven percent say in the next few months, and 43% give a longer time frame or say it never will. Approximately one in five say the virus is already contained or will be in the next few weeks.And those who don't expect social activities and gatherings to resume for a year or longer are particularly likely to expect day-to-day life to be forever changed.Those who give shorter time frames tend to be younger and are more likely to say that once the virus is contained, day-to-day life will return to the way it was before the outbreak.On the other hand, most of those who think the virus will take a year or longer to contain also say life in America will be permanently changed. Most in this group say widespread testing is necessary before opening up the country, and they express more concern over things opening up too fast and the outbreak getting worse than they do over things opening up too slowly and the economy worsening.There are still noticeable partisan differences in these views. A majority of Democrats now say that it will take longer than a few months, while three in four Republicans tell us the opposite â that the virus will be contained in the next few months or sooner. But even among Republicans, that's a noticeably smaller proportion than it was a month ago, when nine in 10 said containment will occur that soon.Scientists and medical professionals, as well as political leaders, have been trying to estimate the potential loss of life from the virus and the success of efforts like social distancing and trying to \"flatten the curve\" of new cases or fatalities. That's been one way to gauge efforts at containment.For regular Americans gauging the success of the U.S. effort in those terms, many say there have already been too many lives lost for them to consider the effort a success. Another 13% say keeping fatalities under fifty thousand would still represent success, while 23% select a range of fifty to 100 thousand. Still another two in ten say it could be more than that.These answers are also colored by partisanship. Most Democrats say that there have already been too many lives lost to call efforts a success, while most Republicans give a range of fifty thousand or more.More see division than unity amid pandemic, but there is near universal pride in health care and essential workersIn its efforts to fight the coronavirus, more feel the country is becoming more divided than united: 42% saying more divided and 27% more united. But nearly all are in agreement in the pride they feel in seeing what those on the front lines are doing, like doctors, nurses and food service workers.Large majorities across demographic groups and partisan stripes are proud of medical personnel and first responders, food service and transportation workers, and even their fellow Americans for staying home and social distancing.Americans also believe the social distancing measures are effective against the outbreak.Neither most Republicans nor most Democrats see unity. But some of that division is evident in assessing how President Trump is responding to the coronavirus. Republicans are proud of how the president is addressing the nation in response to the outbreak, while Democrats are not.When dealing with states, 52% of Americans think the president has considered a state's needs over partisanship, but four in 10 think he has favored Republican states over Democratic ones. Among those who hold the latter view, more than half think the country is becoming more divided.There's also partisan division in overall evaluations of how U.S. efforts to fight the virus are going. Most Republicans think it's going well, but most Democrats think it's going badly.Both Republicans and Democrats are proud of how governors are addressing their states, although Democrats are more likely to feel this way. Far more Republicans are proud of President Trump's response than the governors generally.This CBS News survey was conducted by YouGov using a nationally representative sample of 2,112 U.S. residents interviewed between April 20-22, 2020.

Many say they need to be confident the coronavirus outbreak is over before returning to public places, and big majorities of all partisans agree the stay-at-home orders are effective.The health concerns may be so salient that even for those whose finances have been impacted and even for those concerned about job loss, most of them still worry the country will open up too fast.Sixty-three percent of Americans are more worried about restrictions lifting too fast and worsening the outbreak â than worry about lifting restrictions too slowly and worsening the economy.And what would Americans actually do if restrictions were lifted right now? Would anyone show up to public places or would they be too worried about health risks? That could be the most important factor in the economy.Only 13% say they would definitely return to public places over the next few weeks if restrictions were lifted right now, regardless of what else happened with the outbreak.Almost half â 48% â say they would not return to public places until they were confident the outbreak was over. Another 39% are \"maybes\": they'd return depending on whether they saw the outbreak getting better.  These views are not decidedly partisan: most Republicans are \"maybes\" at best, as are most Democrats and independents.Small numbers for specific things:Only 13% would be comfortable going to a large sports or entertainment event.Only 15% would be comfortable getting on an airplane.29% would be comfortable going to restaurants or bars.Under half â44% â would be comfortable going to a workplace outside the home, though among those who are currently employed, 57% would be comfortable.Most would be comfortable visiting friends.Asked to directly prioritize two tough choices for the nation, health also wins by a roughly similar two-to-one margin. Seventy percent of Americans say keeping people home and social distancing should continue to be the nation's top priority â even if it means the economy is hurt in the short term â and 30% say to send people back to work even if that means increased health risks. But that number has moved, even as it remains a large majority. It was 83% who prioritized staying home three weeks ago.Underpinning all of this is are at least two key factors:First, most don't think the virus will be contained for at least a few more months â in fact, fewer people believe the virus will be contained soon than thought so roughly a month ago. And most still don't think the fight against the virus is going well.Second, many Americans tell us that despite the concern about the economy and their own finances, they think they can last at least a few more weeks before the financial effects of the outbreak hit them. Forty-one percent think they can go on at least another few weeks before finances become a problem, and another 17% don't think they'll be affected. There are one-third who say they've already been impacted â but even for them, most say they're more concerned the country will open up too fast, and say the nation's priority should be to slow the virus.Meanwhile most Americans think stay-at-home orders around the country are working, a view that cuts across party lines. Three in four say that the measures so far are effective when it comes to limiting the spread of the virus nationwide, including large percentages of Democrats, Republicans, and independents.Americans say governors â not the president â should decide when to openMost Americans say their state's governor should make the decisions about whether to reopen the economy in their area, rather than President Trump, or their local county or city officials.And most say widespread testing is a necessity for doing so.Republicans, too, would rather the decision go to their governor than to the president.Most Americans also feel widespread testing is necessary before the opening up the country, though partisan differences are more pronounced on that. Most Democrats and independents think testing is needed. Republicans are less likely to think so.Overall, Americans give their state and local officials in general higher marks for handling the coronavirus than Donald Trump.More than two-thirds of Americans think their state and local officials are doing a good job, while fewer than half think the same of Donald Trump.Views of the president's overall handling of the outbreak remain under half at 48%, little changed from two weeks ago after starting off last month in positive territory.Positive assessments for state and local officials cut across party lines. But partisan divisions remain stark when assessing the president:  55% of Republicans say he is doing a very good job, 69% of Democrats say he is doing a very bad one. Independents are split. Overall, most continue to think things are going badly for the U.S. in its effort to deal with the outbreak, and those assessments are also similar to two weeks ago. Most also see months to go â not weeks â before the nation has it under control.Most Americans oppose protestersA majority of Americans (62%) oppose the protesters who have been in state capitals recently calling for lifting of state lockdowns; by nearly three to one Americans oppose, rather than support them.Slightly more Republicans oppose them than support them, too.Ideologically, it is only the very conservative (not moderates nor the somewhat conservative) among whom the protesters find majority support â and even there, it's 6 in 10.Very few Americans â only 7% â feel President Trump should encourage these protests. Only 13% of Republicans think he should encourage them. In fact, only a quarter of people who support the protesters think the president should encourage the protests.These views come as many Americans are still concerned about potentially getting the virus, and say the priority for the country should be continuing the stay-at-home orders even over the economy.Public supports small business relief but believes funds going to big businessesThe public overwhelmingly approves of Congress passing additional legislation that would provide funds to small businesses impacted by the outbreak: approval stands at 88%, and crosses partisan lines to include about nine in 10 Democrats, Republicans, and independents.The idea of more money for small business may be especially welcome because many Americans think small business hasn't been getting as much of the funding given out thus far. By two to one, the public thinks federal funds have to this point been going to large businesses rather than small ones. Democrats are independents are especially apt to think the money has gone more to large business, and Republicans are split.Congress isn't in session in Washington at the moment, and most Americans, regardless of party affiliation, think Congress should return to Washington immediately to try to deal with the crisis.Neither the Congress nor the president are seen by a majority as doing a good job handling the outbreak. Forty-one percent say Congress is doing a good job, with 59% saying a bad one. Here Democrats, Republicans, and independents are largely in agreement.  That 41% is a relatively lower number for Congress' handling the outbreak than the president's 48%.This CBS News survey was conducted by YouGov using a nationally representative sample of 2,112 U.S. residents interviewed between April 20-22, 2020.

Is that good for the planet?", "bodytext": "The millions of Americans who are skipping their morning commute and working from home because of the coronavirus have drastically reduced smog over America's largest cities and otherwise benefited the environment. Yet the growing ranks of workers now plying their trade online using tools like Zoom and Slack are taking their own toll.  Environmentalists note that the technological infrastructure that supports our online video watching, searching and music playing leaves a large carbon footprint of its own. By some estimates, data centers and the networks that connect them produce as much carbon pollution as the aviation industryâ or about 2% of the world's total.On one hand, the massive drop in car traffic from staying-in-place orders across the country is \"a slam-dunk\" environmentally, said Eric Masanet, a professor of sustainability sciences at the University of California at Santa Barbara. But the relatively lower impact of Netflix binging and many other digital activities doesn't mean we're in the clear.How dirty is the cloud?Indeed, the digital domain is hardly emissions-free. Manufacturing a smartphone, tablet or computer as well as the network that supports them consumes considerable resources â everything from mining rare minerals to laying undersea cables for high-speed internet. And of course it takes oodles of electricity to power the whole system. Electricity in the U.S. still comes overwhelmingly from generators powered by fossil fuels, not wind or solar.\"When we're using our cars, we see that we're using gas â¦ But when you use a computer or a smartphone, it is not so obvious that it's also responsible for greenhouse gas emissions,\" Hugues Ferreboeuf, project director at the Shift Project, a Paris-based think tank, recently told CBS News.The Shift Project issued an alarming report last year that found digital technologies' energy demand was growing at an unsustainable rate. \"The only chance to keep the [global] temperature increase to 2 degrees is to divide by two the greenhouse gas emissions in the next 10 years,\" Ferreboeuf said. \"If we want to change things, there is no alternative to us reviewing the way we use digital.\"  Big data gets biggerThe silver lining is that, at least for now, the energy impact of cloud computing remains relatively modest. Over the past decade, data centers â often called the \"brains\" of the digital world â have massively increased the amount of information they process while increasing energy use only a little. Since 2010, such data crunching has jumped more than fivefold, while energy use rose only about 6%, according to a paper published this year in Science.\"We're consuming much more data than we used to for not that much more energy,\" said Masanet, the paper's lead author. Here's why: Data center operators have become much better at heating and cooling their massive buildings, essentially limiting or even eliminating a function that hogged more energy than running the servers themselves. The trend toward larger centers and better servers over the last decade, led by cloud-computing giants like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft, has also helped lower the energy-to-data ratio.Still, that increase in energy efficiency is unlikely to continue forever.\"The old data centers were kind of like old refrigerators when you didn't put the door on,\" said Arman Shehabi, a coauthor of the paper and research scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. \"Now they put the doors on and it's more efficient. But once they all have doors, you're going to need something new\" to keep energy use under control, he said.Shehabi and Masanet each estimated that we can go another five years without increasing data centers' energy demands. But to keep their energy use from exploding thereafter, governments need to make policy changes â today.\"The industry, policymakers, data center operators, they all have to confront the wave of demand that's coming,\" Masanet said. In particular, technologies including artificial intelligence, 5G, virtual reality and augmented reality are all energy-intensive, and usage is expected to surge in the years to come.Mitigating that energy consumption goes beyond making sure that data centers use the least amount of power possible â it also requires better and wider use of renewable energy.In Europe, where governments are aggressively trying to reduce their carbon emissions, much more electricity is carbon-free than in the U.S., noted Jacqueline Wernimont, distinguished chair in digital humanities and social engagement at Dartmouth College. Wernimont also pointed out that data centers' environmental impact goes beyond carbon emissions. Most emit a constant low hum, creating noise pollution that affects humans and animals. When they are sited near population centers, they tend to be placed in poor neighborhoods (like power plants, landfills and other undesirable infrastructure), to the detriment of the people who live there.Who pays for digital?So has the coronavirus lockdown in the U.S. decreased carbon emissions overall? Scientists are currently exploring that question, and it will likely be months before they can come up with a definitive answer. Yet Masanet has a strong hunch the answer is \"yes\" â even taking into account the rise in binge streaming.\"Of course there's more electricity use from being online more, but the savings we get from avoiding our commutes dwarf any increase in electricity,\" he said. \"My instinct is that, yes, electricity use is going up, but the savings we get nationally from avoided travel is much greater.\"", "section": "MoneyWatch", "bylines": ["Irina Ivanova"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "Americans are Zooming and Slacking into work instead of driving.

According to the Los Angeles Police Department, thieves are also taking advantage of safety measures delivery drivers are following to protect themselves from coronavirus.Police said the drivers are being instructed not to touch doorknobs, gate latches, or any frequently touched surfaces.Sometimes, instead of at your door, packages are placed in exposed visible locations, making it easier for porch pirates to steal.A man in the Melrose District in Los Angeles recently had a package stolen that was left right on a resident's walkway. Police said the video showed a porch pirate in action.Detectives believe the man followed a delivery driver and once the package was left in the front yard, the suspect got out of his car, opened the fence, snatched the package, and left.Pete White, a delivery driver for a big name company said, \"We always get notices that people are following us, describe the color of the vehicle they're in, describe the people, saying be careful out there are people following you. Happens all the time, just ramping up this time.\"Police are reminding delivery drivers that if you think you're being followed, divert your route to confirm the person is following, then call the police.White said he's always aware of his surroundings and wears a mask, gloves and uses hand sanitizer regularly.\"We have to be safe not only for ourselves but for other people because we don't know if the people we're delivering to, they could have underlying problems so we have to be really careful.\"To protect your deliveries, police recommend having your packages delivered to your workplace or install a secure delivery box at your home. You can also have them delivered to UPS or FedEx pick-up spots or Amazon lockers.\"We'll pay more attention when deliveries are coming and follow the tracking and know what time they're coming,\" said homeowner Rae Ann Lanfear.", "section": "Crime", "bylines": ["CBS News"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "Sometimes, instead of at your door, packages are placed in exposed visible locations, making it easier for thieves to steal packages.", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.10481366459627328, "subjectivity": 0.3603320592451027, "wordcount": 340}

We will place no limits on achievement. If we can do this, we can do anything.\"Ferraro wore a white suit in a nod to women's suffrage. Even though she planned for the gravity of her nomination, she was still stunned, as she recalled in a later documentary, to look out and see the convention floor filled with women chanting \"Gerry!\" and wiping tears from their eyes. Before taking the stage, she told her daughters she was determined not to shed any tears herself. \"Women can't cry over these things because it's too emotional, and it's a tough job, and you have to be tough to be vice president of the United States,\" she recalled. Three and a half decades later, as presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden embarks on his own vice presidential search, the shortlist is entirely made up of women. He is also under pressure to make history by picking the first woman of color. The question in 2020 is not if there will be a woman on the ticket, but which woman will it be?As the speculation brews, several potential contenders, like Kamala Harris, Gretchen Whitmer, Stacey Abrams, and Elizabeth Warren, have said outright they would take the job, breaking with the tradition of demure sidestepping when asked. Senators Amy Klobuchar and Catherine Cortez Masto are also said to be in contention for the role, as well as Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. The confidence of the women on today's shortlist comes after a record number of women ran for president this cycle, and after 2020, when, for the first time in history, a major party nominee was a woman, Hillary Clinton. This is a very different year than 1984 â record numbers of women from a variety of backgrounds and geographical locations, are being elected to Congress. In 2020, there are 126 women in Congress â over 100 more than when Ferraro was running for vice president.\"I think what we saw in 2018 was women running more authentically, talking about all the different aspects of their lives,\" said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics. After Ferraro's nomination, it would be 24 years before another woman, Republican Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, would be selected as a running mate. But now, Democrats say it would be nearly impossible to create a list of running mates without including a significant number of women. \"This election is going to be decided by women voters,\" said Christina Reynolds of Emily's List and a veteran of Clinton's 2016 campaign. \"When you look at who is driving change in this era, it's women.\" Gerry in the gapWomen voters have been outnumbering male voters in presidential elections since 1964, but it was in 1980 when a new phenomenon in politics appeared: the gender gap. The election of Ronald Reagan showed that women were voting for a different candidate than men were, and that women were more likely to support the Democratic candidate. By the summer of 1984, Reagan was well on his way to re-election. His Democratic opponent, Walter Mondale, knew that if he ran a traditional campaign, he would never \"get in the game,\" as he recalled in his book, \"The Good Fight.\" He drew up a short list that included Ferraro, who was also heading the convention platform committee at the time, and San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein. Ferraro indicated if offered the job she'd say yes, but she still never expected to get it. Mondale's wife Joan urged him to pick a woman to \"break the white-male mold\" and to tap into the new strength of the women's vote. \"Picking Ferraro was symbolic in that sense, but a symbolic gesture with consequences,\" Mondale wrote in his book. \"Skeptical voters would see what an effective woman candidate could accomplish. Young women could see new horizons open up. Everyone would see how America had changed in our lifetimes, and more doors would open.\"After Ferraro's nomination that July, the gender gap was front and center. In August 1984, The Nation published an article titled \"Gerry in the Gap,\" which addressed not only the symbolic nature of her choice as running mate but also highlighted issues she was known to champion. It also provided a glimpse at how women in politics would be covered when they sought higher office. \"Geraldine Ferraro has made her way in this male preserve by being both feminine and feminist,\" Evan Thomas wrote in a TIME magazine profile of Ferraro. \"Her hair is frosted blonde, she wears stockings and makeup, and she loves to shop. When she needs to, she can flirt. But she is also tough and resilient, a shrewd back-room operator.\"Ferraro had to navigate terrain that had not applied to her predecessors. There was no playbook for running on a major presidential ticket as a woman â from how she spoke and dressed to how she interacted with her running mate and where she stood on issues.  \"She was a person who didn't really have a choice but to be authentic,\" her daughter Donna Zaccaro told CBS News.Ferraro also faced questions not typically asked. When confronted during an interview, \"And if you weren't a woman, do you think you would have been selected?\" She replied, \"I don't know if I were not a woman, I would be judged in the same way, my candidacy. Whether or not I'd be asked questions like, you know, 'Are you strong enough to push the button?'\"Ferraro was the first woman to appear as a candidate in a nationally televised election debate. In the New Republic, she was praised for her performance against Vice President George H.W. Bush, \"the super-credentialed Brahmin Yalie behaved like a frightened oaf, while the Italian-American ex-housewife displayed calm, breeding, and self-possession.\" But it also touched on the historic nature of her appearance, \"There is still a touch of Eliza Doolittle in Ferraro.\" After the debate, Bush took some heat when he said, \"We tried to kick a little ass last night.\"By the late summer and into the fall, Ferraro was also hampered by the focus on her spouse. To start, the campaign faced intense pressure for her husband John Zaccaro to release his tax returns. In late August, Ferraro released a trove of financial records, but it raised more questions about real estate transactions and disclosures. Ferraro ended up holding a two-hour press conference to address the matter. According to a New York Times report at the time, Reagan campaign manager Ed Rollins said she had become a \"drag\" on the campaign. Post-election interviews revealed there were in fact deliberate Republican efforts to take down a perceived threat. In the end, Reagan won in a landslide. Post-election autopsies pointed to a number of factors not related to Ferraro. She may in fact have provided a slight bump that would not have otherwise existed, but despite putting \"Gerry in the Gap,\" exit polling by The New York Times/CBS News found 62 percent of men and 56 percent of women voted for Reagan. It would be nearly a quarter of a century before there would be another woman running mate. In a 2002 interview, Ferraro was asked if it was all worth it. \"Oh absolutely,\" she said. \"We did make a difference. We opened that door for women.\"Along came Palin In suspending her 2008 presidential bid, Hillary Clinton said that while she wasn't able to shatter the glass ceiling \"it's got about 18 million cracks in it,\" and \"the path will be easier next time.\"Soon after, Republican nominee John McCain unveiled his running mate, a little-known governor from Alaska, at a rally in Dayton, Ohio. \"She's not from these parts, and she's not from Washington, but when you get to know her, you're going to be as impressed as I am,\" he said of Sarah Palin. Palin, flanked by her husband and children, referenced Clinton's speech from weeks earlier.  \"Hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest, hardest glass ceiling in America, but it turns out the women of America aren't finished yet, and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all.\"John McCain' choice of Palin as his running mate was the surprise of the summer of 2008, and the apparent fumbles in vetting and his lack of familiarity with Palin would later be revealed in campaign autopsies. But at the time, McCain's campaign was facing a number of challenges that could be addressed with the selection of a running mate. At 72, he would have been the oldest candidate elected to a first term in the White House. Conservatives and evangelicals were skeptical of him. And he was facing an opponent with a historic candidacy in his own right, and white working women with children were a key battleground. \"She was a late addition to the short list, catapulted into contention by the campaign's calculus that a woman would broaden the ticket's appeal,\" wrote AB Culverhouse, who ran McCain's search team, in an op-ed.  \"The names at the top of the ballot on Nov. 4 will be McCain and Obama, but the juicier battle this fall for an important group of swing voters - white working women with children - may be fought between the other two stars of the Republican and Democratic conventions, Sarah Palin and Hillary Rodham Clinton,\" read a New York Times article in September, 2008.\"It was a drastic misunderstanding of the gender gap,\" said Walsh of the idea of a Clinton/Palin crossover voter.  Palin electrified the audience at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul that September, giving a rousing speech scattered with anecdotes about her family and children. She spoke of herself as a mother of a son who was about to deploy to Iraq and of another born with special needs. She said she learned from her parents, both elementary school teachers, that \"this is America, and every woman can walk through every door of opportunity.\" And, perhaps among the most memorable lines from the speech, Palin described herself as \"just your average hockey mom and signed up for the PTA.\"Conservatives lavished praise for the speech, and the convention earned the ticket a bump in the polls. But it didn't last long. Palin's vice presidential candidacy was hampered by a series of other events from her inability to name what newspapers she read in an interview with Katie Couric to headlines about how the Republican National Committee spending more than $150,000 on clothing and accessories for the Republican VP nominee, a minefield that not only raised outrage over the costs but also showcased just how important appearance was made to be. Palin became a punchline on \"Saturday Night Live,\" played by Tina Fey. In his 2018 memoir, McCain admitted he regretted taking his campaign staff's advice to put Palin on the ticket â \"my gut told me to ignore it, and I wished I had.\"In the end, President Obama won the 2008 election with 56% of women's support to McCain's 43%. However, while Mr. Obama won among women overall, McCain won white women 53% to 46%. That racial divide among women voters held in 2016, when Hillary Clinton won among women overall, but Donald Trump won the majority of white women. The power of black womenAs Biden begins his own vice presidential selection process, his challenge isn't to woo women voters, it is to pay homage to what they have already meant both to the Democratic Party and to his own candidacy. And black women have proven to be a driving force of the Democratic base.\"Black women have been the highest turnout, most loyal Democrats for the past 50 years since we've had access to the ballot box,\" said said Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, which works to elect women of color. According to presidential exit polls dating back to at least 1972, black women have supported the Democratic presidential nominee in every election by at least 86% or more. In 2016, 96% of black women supported the Democratic ticket. \"It's recognizing a historic trend that's been in place but hasn't been spoken about,\" Allison said of the idea of Biden naming a woman of color as his running mate.  She argued it would be necessary not just to balance the ticket and build excitement and turnout. Her message if his pick isn't a woman of color, \"he doesn't want to win.\"Biden's decision to select a woman running mate also comes in the wake of the global 2016 Women's March and the #MeToo movement. It remains to be seen how a woman vice presidential nominee will navigate the political climate differently after such shifts, but all have had an impact on how women run for office. \"We're waiting to see if this is the one that wins,\" said Walsh. \"We've had the first ever.

There is no allegation of illegality associated with its loan.But the size of the loan â $2.85 million â is nearly 14 times the current PPP average of $206,000. Meantime, hundreds of thousands of smaller businesses got nothing, because the nearly $350 billion loan program ran out of money in just two weeks. (Congress is allocating another $310 billion to the PPP loan fund this week.)The speed of Phunware's loan is notable, too. The publicly traded Texas-based company named a high-profile former Wall Street executive as its corporate board chair on March 30, the day after the PPP program was passed by Congress as part of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act. The executive is Blythe Masters, who until 2014 had spent most of her financial services career at JPMorgan Chase, the bank that made the PPP loan to Phunware. The company received its loan funds two days after applying.\"It was supposed to be first come, first serve,\" said Lou Rabon, the CEO of Cyber Defense Group, a security consultancy in New York that also applied for a PPP loan through JPMorgan Chase. Roban is the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit seeking class-action status against JPMorgan Chase that alleges the bank unfairly favored larger clients to boost its profits from originating loans for the federal program. \"Data provided by the U.S. Small Business Administration reveals that  . . . Chase prioritized and front-loaded applications with higher loan amounts,\" according to the suit.Rabon's company applied for a loan of less than $200,000 on April 6, the first day JPMorgan Chase began accepting applications. Phunware applied for its loan through JPMorgan Chase on April 8 and received the money on April 10, according to a statement at the time from its CEO and a financial filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Rabon is still waiting. \"My opinion of Chase is not very high right now,\" he said.Phunware CEO Alan Knitowski and Masters did not return requests for comment for this story. A spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase said it does not comment on individual borrowers. The bank declined to comment on the lawsuit or its merits.A potential power in tracking location dataPhunware was paid nearly $3 million in revenue from the Trump re-election campaign last year, or roughly 15% of its nearly $20 million in total sales, according to a filing with the SEC. In 2018, 66% of its $31 million revenue at the time came from work for client Fox Networks. Phunware has not disclosed how much it expects to make from the Trump campaign this year. But the company has said in filings it is actively pursuing political work during the 2020 presidential election cycle.Much of the company's business has revolved around developing apps for clients such as Fox and the NFL, and collecting data about users from those apps, according to Brittany Kaiser, the former business development director for Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that performed data analysis for the 2016 Trump campaign. Kaiser was named to Phunware's board of advisers in June 2019, but said she soon after decided not to join the firm because it agreed to serve Trump's 2020 re-election efforts.\"They have capabilities that Cambridge never had; Cambridge didn't really develop apps,\" Kaiser said. \"Cambridge bought location data but they didn't collect it themselves.\" In a 2019 presentation to investors, Phunware said it has the ability to collect location data from more than 1 billion active mobile devices per month. A spokesperson for the Trump 2020 campaign did not reply to questions sent for this article.On Sunday, Knitowski tweeted out a link to the Donald Trump for President app. \"Together, let's Keep America Great. @phunware,\" Knitowski wrote in the tweet.Phunware was founded in 2009 by Knitowski and Chief Technical Officer Luam Dang. The company has raised over $100 million since then and has posted millions in losses. In an April financial filing, Phunware stated the company has \"a history of operating losses and negative operating cash flows and expects these trends to continue into the foreseeable future.\"In late 2018, Phunware went public through a complex transaction involving a shell company controlled by two Greek shipping executives. At the time, Phunware said it was launching its own digital currency, the PhunCoin. Caught up in one of the waves of investor hype surrounding bitcoin and other digital currencies, shares of Phunware soared 2,100% in early 2019, to more than $300 from $14. When that wave broke, the company's stock crashed. Phunware's shares recently traded for just 64 cents each. The company says it has put PhunCoin on hold.In the past month, however, Phunware has announced the launch of a national registry for ventilators and a product the company said would use geo-location data to help governments manage pandemic response programs and track cases. As of Thursday, Phunware's national ventilator registry is a single webpage allowing hospitals and others to input their ventilator information.Success in small business loans JPMorgan Chase has said all the firms that got PPP loans through the bank were customers. But JPMorgan was not Phunware's first stop, CEO Knitowski told the hometown Austin Business Journal on April 16. The company initially asked Western Alliance's Bridge Bank for help but was informed the bank was not participating in the Paycheck Protection Program, Knitowski said. Western Alliance's website says it did offer loans from the program, and a company presentation says the bank approved roughly $1.5 billion in PPP loans to 2,600 applicants.Masters, the former JPMorgan executive,  joined Phunware's board in late December. On March 30, the day after the CARES Act passed, Phunware announced her elevation to chair of its board of directors. The company has yet to disclose how much it is paying Masters for serving on its board, but filings show in late February it awarded her 125,523 shares in restricted stock units that vest over 13 months. The shares were worth nearly $160,000 at the time of the grant.Masters was a star in the JPMorgan universe who led a team of bankers in the mid-1990s who pioneered credit default swaps, the derivative contracts that ultimately played a role in stoking the housing bubble that led to the 2008 financial crisis. She rose to head JPMorgan's highly profitable commodities division, and was seen as a possible successor to CEO Jamie Dimon, but left the bank in 2014. After JPMorgan, Masters was the CEO of Digital Assets Holdings, a blockchain technology developer. She left that company in late 2018.A spokesperson for JPMorgan declined to answer if Masters had any role in helping Phunware navigate JPMorgan's PPP loan process. Messages left for Masters at Motive Partners, the private equity firm she joined in December, were not returned.The math behind the moneyPhunware said in an April 13 press release touting its $2.85 million in small businesses aid that \"PPP loan proceeds will primarily be used for payroll costs and to retain workers.\" The Payroll Protection Program provides loans to cover eight weeks of worker pay. Phunware had 93 employees as of the end of last year, according to SEC filings. But its payroll expenses have recently shrunk: It furloughed 37 employees in the first quarter, according to a March 30 filing with the SEC.In order for Phunware to have its entire loan plus 1% interest forgiven by the government, it would have to rehire all furloughed workers who had been employed as of mid-February and pay them for eight weeks, according to the rules of the Paycheck Protection Program. Phunware did not respond to a question from CBS News as to whether it has rehired any furloughed workers since receiving its loan proceeds.In the April 16 interview with the Austin Business Journal, Knitowski declined to say how the PPP funds would be used. \"We're more focused to get through the unknown,\" he told the publication, and the $2.8 million loan \"enables us to navigate these uncertain times.\"Nearly 1.7 million small businesses got a piece of the $350 billion PPP pie before the money was spent. But sizable companies with access to public markets and investors also managed to get loans. As of Wednesday, 151 publicly traded companies, including the owners of the Ruth's Chris Steak House chain and the Pollo Tropical restaurant chain as well as Phunware, had disclosed they had received nearly $540 million in PPP loans, according to an analysis of SEC data by CBS News. (On Thursday, the owner of Ruth's Chris said it would return the money it got from its PPP loan.) About 20% of the total loan money was extended by JPMorgan Chase, the country's largest bank by assets.NPR reported Tuesday that another company with ties to the White House received a large PPP loan. Continental Materials Corp., which manufactures heating and cooling equipment, received a $5.5 million loan, according to public filings. The company is majority-owned by the family of U.S. Ambassador to Belgium Ronald Gidwitz, who was the campaign finance chair for Mr. Trump's 2016 presidential campaign in Illinois.President Trump was asked Monday during a White House press briefing about large companies receiving Paycheck Protection Program loans. He indicated his administration may ask some recipients to return the funds.\"If somebody got something that we think is inappropriate we'll get it back,\" Mr. Trump said.Additional reporting by CBS News' Megan Towey.", "section": "MoneyWatch", "bylines": ["Stephen Gandel"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "Public company whose board chair is a former top JPMorgan Chase executive received nearly $3 million from the bank.", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.03395252069359213, "subjectivity": 0.3360155320869608, "wordcount": 1604}

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman says health and testing are top priorities", "bodytext": "Millions of sports fans will tune into their first major event in six weeks, as the NFL draft kicks off Thursday night. For the first time, the draft will take place virtually, with Commissioner Roger Goodell announcing picks from his basement.It comes as sports leagues around the world grapple with how to return after coronavirus cancellations.\"It's actually like a 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle that doesn't have borders,\" NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman told \"CBS This Morning: Saturday\" co-host Dana Jacobson.Bettman is just one executive trying to steer his sport through an unknown landscape.\"If we can play in a small window without fans, we'll be prepared to do that. If we need to go to centralized locations with no fans and modify the schedule, we'll do that. We will be as agile and as adaptable as we can be,\" he said. Bettman and fellow commissioners from both team and individual sports have had ongoing discussions with President Donald Trump about an inevitable return.Pro sports like hockey, basketball and golf had their seasons paused by the pandemic, while others like baseball have yet to start.Bettman said for all sports, health and testing are the top priorities.\"It's one, getting the number of tests you need to be comfortable that you're doing the right things and coming together. And two, we don't want to be in a situation where we're depriving the medical community of the tests they may need to deal with people who are ill,\" he said. Asked if he feels pressure to get back to playing, the commissioner said, \"We feel pressure, but it's really perhaps internalized in terms of what we represent.\"Baltimore Ravens defensive end Calais Campbell, a 13-year NFL veteran and member of the NFL Players Association executive committee, said he wonders if there will be a football season and said his biggest concern going forward is \"the fan involvement.\" Campbell also said health is on the minds of players. Two players in the NFL have tested positive for coronavirus, including his close friend Denver Broncos linebacker Von Miller.Campbell said \"it's pretty scary\" to see healthy, pro athletes like himself catching the virus.\"And that goes into the going back to work,\" he said. \"We could all be sick and not even know it. ... You might not have symptoms.\"But while every sport is different, Campbell said he believes no matter how each comes back, with fans or without, it's the return that matters most.\"Sports brings happiness. I mean that's one of the best things about sports ... gives you something to believe in. Here's your reason to hope. Everybody has their team they want to hope wins the game or goes and wins the championship, and that's what makes sports special,\" he said. \"I really do think sports will be beneficial for a lot of people right now going through tough times. Just bringing back somebody to root for.\"To get those sports back, leagues are considering neutral sites, limited sites and no fans. As far as dates to come back, there's no word yet from the MLB. The NBA and NHL have said they can play late into summer to finish this season, which is their priority. The PGA Tour is looking at a June return without fans, but said that is contingent on available testing for players, caddies and support personnel.", "section": "CBS This Morning", "bylines": ["CBS News"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "Millions of sports fans will tune into their first major event in six weeks, as the NFL draft kicks off Thursday night.", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.10069424402757736, "subjectivity": 0.44946248196248195, "wordcount": 551}

Right now, CBS News political unit associate producers Sarah Ewall-Wice and Eleanor Watson say U.S. leaders are grappling with how to reopen parts of the country, but according to the latest CBS News polling, 63% of Americans are worried about opening too fast and the outbreak worsening, while just 37% worry about the economy opening too slowly and the economy growing worse. And even as the president urges opening up the country in phases, 47% of Republicans believe the governors should decide when states reopen and only 37% believe the president should decide. Both Republicans and Democrats approve of how governors are handling the crisis in their states, however, more Democrats than Republicans are proud of governors, and far more Republicans (73%) are proud of Mr. Trump's response to the outbreak than of the governors' response generally. Views of Mr. Trump's overall handling of the coronavirus outbreak have changed very little in the past few weeks. The newest polling has his approval at 48% compared to 47% two weeks ago. When it comes to campaigning for the general election, candidates might have to wait awhile before drumming up support at rallies. According to the latest poll, voters in both parties are hesitant to return to public places before the outbreak is over. Only 13% of all voters say they would definitely return to public places over the next few weeks if restrictions were lifted right now. Forty-eight percent of voters would not return to public places until they were confident the outbreak is over, and 39% said they would \"maybe\" return if they saw the outbreak getting better. At the same time, among places Americans said they would be willing to go should stay-at-home orders be lifted, only 13% said they would be comfortable at a large sporting or entertainment event, 15% said they'd be comfortable getting on an airplane and only 29% said they would be comfortable going to a bar or restaurant. This comes as multiple protests against stay-at-home orders have taken place at state capitals across the country. According to the polling, only 23% of Americans support the protests, while 62% oppose them. Among those who oppose them are 82% of Democrats, 62% of Independents and 46% of Republicans (more than the 43 percent that support them). Additionally, only 13% of Republicans believe the president should encourage them; the majority of Republicans believe he should either discourage them or not say anything at all.  Though 70% of Americans saying staying home and stopping the spread of the virus should be the top priority, many Americans are already feeling an impact on their finances. According to the polling, 36% are already feeling the financial effect, while 41% say it will affect their finances in a few weeks or longer. Only 17% said it would not impact their finances. To that end, the public overwhelmingly approves â 88 to 12% â of Congress passing additional legislation to help small businesses. Right now, the majority of Democrats and independents believe the federal funding is mostly going to large businesses while Republicans are split. Sixty-one percent of Americans believe Congress should immediately return to Washington to deal with the outbreak while just 39% do not.No matter what happens, when this is all said and done,  54% of Americans believe life in American will be permanently changed after the coronavirus. Forty-six percent believe there will be an eventual return to normal.FROM THE CANDIDATESJOE BIDENBeyond the Trump administration's public health response to COVID-19, Joe Biden is also tailoring criticism toward the president's handling of the economic side effects, alleging Mr. Trump is unable to manage the sudden financial crisis millions of Americans find themselves in, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. After the new unemployment numbers today, Biden said in a statement, \"Every worker left wondering when they will next see a paycheck is part of this American crisis â and Donald Trump isn't doing enough for them.\" While the president pushes state leaders to find ways to allow some businesses to reopen when deemed safe, Biden says businesses should remain closed in unsafe areas. In order to keep employees of these closed businesses on the payroll, he advocates for nationwide work-sharing structures. Looking ahead, by drawing attention to the economic crisis associated with the pandemic, Biden lays the groundwork to highlight the likely financial strains many Americans will be under later this year even if the risk to their physical health subsides. On the primary trail, Biden was frequently critical of Mr. Trump's boasts of the once-booming economy as he said the Obama-Biden administration set the economic growth in motion.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMPThe Trump campaign launched its 2020 campaign app designed to ramp up voter engagement and data collection ahead of the November election. CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga says the latest development in the campaign's online recalibration offers supporters opportunities to phone bank, register voters or host a meet-up for Team Trump. Also up for grabs? Rewards. Similar to a video game, participants can earn points for helping to expand the campaign's digital footprint â share a Trump tweet to win one point. Convince a neighbor to download the app for one hundred points. Individuals earning 5,000 points earn a campaign store discount, while 100,000 points gets you a picture with the president himself. The app has been in the works for over a year. The campaign began testing the app in January, with plans to deploy the digital tool at a smaller \"Keep America Great\" rally. Yet with the coronavirus pandemic putting a pause on all campaign rallies, the application has been retooled to promote virtual events and was announced via Twitter.Separately the Trump campaign is pushing for the removal of a Democratic Super PAC ad on a local station in Michigan. According to a cease and desist letter sent to the station in Grand Rapids provided by the American Bridge PAC, CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice reports the campaign is demanding that they stop airing the ad titled \"Trust\" which takes on the president's response to the coronavirus and China. The letter reads in part, \"The AB PAC ad's central premise is based on the deliberately false, misleading, and deceptive claim that, 'Trump sent seventeen tons of American masks and medical supplies to China. Our masks and supplies.' This allegation is materially misleading and is willfully blind to the most basic context.\" On February 7, the State Department did announce it was facilitating the transport of \"nearly 17.8 tons of donated medical supplies to the Chinese people, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials.\" According to the State Department, those supplies were \"donated by the American people.\" This is not the first time the Trump campaign has sent a cease and desist letter to a television station over a Super PAC ad in the 2020 campaign cycle. On April 13, the Trump campaign announced it was suing a station in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, for carrying an ad by Priorities USA that was airing in battleground states which slammed Trump's coronavirus response. The Trump campaign claims it manipulated audio clips to create an entirely new sentence. When the Trump campaign first sent a cease and desist letter to the station over that ad in March, Priorities USA responded by expanding its ad buy.VEEPSTAKESSTACEY ABRAMSStacey Abrams went further in depth today on why she would be a strong running mate for Joe Biden, according to CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte. During a live-streamed chat with Color for Change, a civil rights 501(c)(4), Abrams gave a blow-by-blow explanation of her credentials. Abrams said that she must be direct with her ambition or else, as an African-American, she would be discounted. \"As a person of color I cannot be shy about my response because any hint that I don't think I'm qualified, that I don't think we can, is used as a justification for saying that we can't,\" she said. Abrams went on: \"This isn't about ambition for me, it's about ambition for our people  â that we should be considered and should be elevated to a place where we can help represent and serve our communities.\" She also discussed her philosophy for winning in November. Abrams acknowledged the need to win in the Midwest working class areas, but contended that she would help galvanize voters in more urban areas. \"We have to win those blue wall states but we also have to expand the map because we keep â if we keep playing the last election while the other side is running the next election, we will continue to fall behind,\" she said. \"And the thing is we need someone who can not only win Saginaw and Racine, and Scranton, we need to win Detroit and Milwaukee and Philadelphia.\"AMY KLOBUCHARWhile her name is being floated as a running mate for Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar, in a round of media appearances, continued her November focus on how to keep elections safe in the post-pandemic era, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports.  As scientific debate continues on whether public gatherings later this fall will be safe or not, the Minnesota senator is leading a push for greater financial support to states considering greater absentee voting measures. \"People should not have to make a decision between voting and their health,\" Klobuchar said, stating there is bipartisan support for both granting financial assistance for states to implement more vote by mail opportunities and initiating an extension of early in-person voting to limit congregation on Election Day.In one of her appearances Thursday, Klobuchar joined Rock the Vote along with When We All Vote, a nonpartisan initiative by former First Lady Michelle Obama, on a call to push for federal legislation to expand mail-in voting. \"We cannot even be certain where students are going to be on Election Day,\" said Oregon Senator Ron Wyden. \"We want to COVID-proof the election in America.\" Wyden and Klobuchar have introduced a bill to expand no-excuse absentee vote-by-mail, early-in-person voting and reimburse states for election-related costs during the pandemic. Klobuchar told CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion Democratic senators have sent a letter to congressional leaders calling for $3.6 billion to be included in a fourth coronavirus aid package. \"That is a realistic number for what we need and we're just going to negotiate everything we can,\" Klobuchar said to CBS News. She also touted the bill during an Instagram live chat with When We All Vote co-chair Valerie Jarrett. It was hosted by the nonprofit organization, The United State of Women. \"This doesn't have anything to do with who wins but it has everything to do with making the voters safe,\" Klobuchar told Jarrett.ELIZABETH WARRENSenator Elizabeth Warren said on Thursday that her oldest brother, Don Reed Herring, had died from coronavirus. \"I'm grateful to the nurses and frontline staff who took care of him, but it's hard to know that there was no family to hold his hand or to say 'I love you' one more timeâand no funeral for those of us who loved him to hold each other close,\" she tweeted. Herring, who was 86 and lived in Oklahoma, died on Tuesday, Warren said. A long-time military man who fought in Vietnam and a lifelong Republican, CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak says he had been a fixture in the progressive senator's presidential campaign stump speech. \"I mentioned my three brothers. One is a Democrat. Do the math,\" Warren frequently told voters asking her how she'd bridge the partisan divide. \"But here's the thing: I think about the things that unite us.\" GRETCHEN WHITMERMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer commented in a CNN interview Thursday morning on speculation that she is on a shortlist to become Joe Biden's running mate. Asked if the state of Michigan can spare losing its governor during the coronavirus pandemic to campaign, CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman says Whitmer responded, \"The job that I want is the one that I have. I worked for two years to become the governor of the state of Michigan.\" In a separate interview on MSNBC, Whitmer criticized Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's comment that he is in \"favor of allowing states\" to go bankrupt. McConnell made the comment in an interview with Hugh Hewitt. \"I was really disappointed to see Senator McConnell's comments about letting states go bankrupt,\" Whitmer said. \"I just think that it's incredibly irresponsible.\"GOVERNOR'S MANSIONHELP WANTEDGovernors across the political spectrum are continuing to speak up about the need for federal funding as they deal with the pandemic's brutal impact on their state budgets, says CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. Most states are expecting to see a substantial loss in tax revenue due to the economic downturn, and some are already acknowledging the incoming budget cuts to come. Republican Governor Kristi Noem said that while her state has always been a \"really thrifty state,\" they'll be seeing a substantial tax revenue loss. \"All I really want to do is make sure that I don't have to slash teacher funding, to make sure that I don't have to slash highway maintenance,\" she said. \"I don't want to have to cut funding for nursing homes. But that is situation that they are putting me in. Now that is not conservative.\" In response to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's suggestion that bankruptcy be an option for states with decimated budgets and that there shouldn't be any \"blue state bailouts,\" New York Governor Cuomo said it was \"one of the really dumb ideas of all timeâ¦The entire nation is dependent on what the governors do to reopen. But then you're not going to fund the state government? You think I'm going to do it alone? How do you think this is going to work?\" Cuomo said Thursday. \"'I mean for crying out loud. If there's ever a time to stop your obsessive political bias and anger...now is the time.\"The decimating of state budgets comes as states continue to extend their stay-at-home orders, while also working through how they can reopen their economies. A new roadmap by the National Governors Association hopes to help states out with that, though it warns that the sufficient amount of resources needed, such as testing and PPE supplies, may not be there yet. The report observes that testing capacity in the U.S. remains \"inadequate\" to move forward, despite repeated assurances from the White House that the U.S. has enough testing for states that meet other criteria to begin to reopen, reports CBS News digital political reporter Kathryn Watson. \"Opening prematurely â or opening without the tools in place to rapidly identify and stop the spread of the virus â could send states back into crisis mode, push health systems past capacity, and force states back into strict social distancing measures,\" the report reads. ISSUES THAT MATTERJOBSAnother 4.4 million Americans filed for unemployment insurance for the week ending April 18, the Labor Department reported on Thursday, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to roil the U.S. job market. Over the past five weeks, since businesses around the country began closing due to the virus, CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster notes about 26.5 million workers have filed jobless claims. The weekly number reported on Thursday is the fourth highest ever recorded by the Labor Department, but it is a drop from the 5.2 million claims for the week ending April 11. More than 6 million people filed claims in the weeks ending April 4 and March 28. The advance number of continuing claims for the week ending April 11 is just under 16 million. That indicates how many people are actually receiving unemployment benefits. Before the coronavirus pandemic, the previous weekly high for continuing claims was 6.6 million people in May 2009.Those numbers are all seasonally adjusted, which \"attempts to measure and remove the influences of predictable seasonal patterns\" to show how employment levels change over time. The unadjusted numbers show that more than 24.3 million workers have filed claims the past five weeks. That dwarfs previous five week stretches, according to Heidi Shierholz, who served as chief economist at the Labor Department from 2014-2017 during the Obama administration and is now with the Economic Policy Institute. \"In the period before the coronavirus hit, just over a million workers would apply for UI in a typical five-week span, and in the worst five-week stretch of the Great Recession, it was less than four million,\" Shierholz wrote in a blog post. She says more than 1 in 7 workers have lost jobs based on the unadjusted jobless numbers. Shierholz also estimates that about 71% of people who have filed for unemployment between March 14 and April 11 are receiving their benefits.  PRIMARILY CONCERNEDKANSASTomorrow is the deadline for registered voters in Kansas to request a mail-in ballot for the Democratic primary in that state, which was originally scheduled for May 2. While Joe Biden is the presumptive nominee, CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar says all formally filed candidates will remain on the ballot and voters can still choose to vote their preference on their ranked-choice ballots. Any candidates that reaches the 15% viability will be awarded Kansas delegates. Earlier this month, after Senator Bernie Sanders dropped out of the race, Kansas Democratic Party Chair Vicki Hiatt urged voters to still participate during the vote by mail primary. \"If we want to make sure voters have the option to vote-by-mail in future elections, especially for the November general election if the COVID-19 virus has not been contained, Kansas must prove that vote-by-mail keeps our communities safe and makes our democracy stronger.\" In late March, the KDP and the Democratic National Committee moved forward with a plan to conduct the primary completely by mail in an effort to help stop the spread of coronavirus. The KDP sent out more than 370,000 ballots to registered Democrats in the state. CAMPAIGN STRATEGYBATTLEGROUND ORGANIZINGOrganizing Together 2020, an independent campaign coalition made up of presidential campaign alumni, is working with two new partners to jumpstart their presence and work in battleground states. The Congressional Black Caucus PAC and Giffords gun safety group will be working with the organization to build up and train campaign volunteers in six states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.The new partnerships add to OT2020's roster of labor unions and progressive groups that they're working with through the election. Giffords political director Joanna Belanger told CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro that OT2020 will serve as a \"one-stop shop\" for volunteers to learn the information and messaging on everything from gun violence to education to campaign finance reform. \"What they're doing is super important,\" she said. \"Making sure voters, in key swing states that will decide the election, understand what's at stake and who they should be voting for.\" The CBC PAC says OT2020 will also help with informing voters on how to cast their ballots, especially as more elections push the use of absentee and mail ballots. The PAC's political director, Niccara Campbell, said current CBC members will also be made available to support and energize volunteers. \"Whether it be cheering on as a surrogate to get everyone together, to lend their voices, to get everyone pepped up and ready to go â anything in that realm, that's exactly what they'll be lending their voice to,\" she said. While OT2020 said it's already planning to do a lot of digital work, the group has adapted to the pandemic by honing in on text-messaging mobilization and using Zoom to connect with volunteers. OT2020 National communications director Geoff Burgan told Navarro while lots of Democrats had multiple favorite candidates in mind during the primaries, \"the overriding thing for so many of them was, 'How do I defeat Donald Trump and his policies?' 'How do I get started on that today?' That's going to be the point across the groups, so many of our members want to get their organizing started as soon as they can,\" he added.", "section": "Politics", "bylines": ["Caitlin Conant"], "source": {"@id": "https://www.cbsnews.com/"}, "summary": "Some 63% of Americans are worried about opening too fast and the outbreak worsening, while just 37% worry about the economy opening too slowly and the economy growing worse, according to a new CBS News poll.", "previousfetches": 1, "sentiment": 0.13110859655880838, "subjectivity": 0.4160546597940665, "wordcount": 3350}
